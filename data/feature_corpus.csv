"I personally use myfitnesspal, it’s the easiest free app for me and lets you pick your own intake limit meanwhile a lot of other ones don’t let you go below 1200 or pick it for you. I really loved nutra check because it was my favourite and easiest calorie counting app and had all kinds of features like barcode scanning and custom amounts of foods but the free trial eventually ran out and after that it limits you to 5 food logs a day so I went back to MFP"
"LoseIt, Myfitnesspal, Cronometer take your pick based on personal preference. Personally I use loseit with a free account and just manually add when the barcode scanner doesn’t pick up or isn’t accurate. Ads get annoying but that’s just how it goes for free users."
"After myfitnesspal started charging to use the barcode feature, I switched to macrosfirst and I've been satisfied with it"
yazio is my fav
yazio !! i like it tbh
dont use mfp lose it is sm better
I second my net diary! I'm currently using the premium because it was on offer for £11 a year so I thought I'd give it a go but I was perfectly happy with the free version too and had no issues using it. I'll be going back to the free version at the end of the year if there's not another offer on for premium as I don't think it's worth full price.
Back to check out what other apps there are. Was fascinated by cronometer till I saw that they don't have Chinese food. Mfp has a wide database and it suits my local food culture better. OP should try out everything to see which suits them better too💪
"I’ve tried both, I like lose it."
I find loseit pretty good for Chinese food too! I think it has a good sized user database. I just added some lamb soup noodles yesterday and chili oil marinated chicken recently so it's more than just American Chinese food.
I will forever be a fan of cronometer but I've heard a lot of good things about macrofactor. They cost money but it's less expensive than a lot of premium subscriptions to other tracking apps
I use myfitnesspal and I've lost around 4 kgs in the past 2 months (just started calorie counting 1 month ago). Most people recommend it - doesn't have disruptive ads or any distracting content.
I use mynetdiary. Im down 18 pounds in 88 days and its free with no ads
I've been using mynetdiary and I've liked it so far. Just doing the free version because the premium stuff isn't really necessary. I'll take a look at the loseit app. Thanks!
"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calorie-counter-mynetdiary/id287529757 MyNet Diary, this one is probably the best I’ve used by far👍🏽"
For what it's worth I just downloaded and tried all 3 and I prefer Cronometer - much simpler than myfitnesspal without as many gimmicky features I don't need.
Hi there! Our sincerest apologies for any issues you're experiencing with MyFitnessPal. Our team is always happy to assist! Please send an email to [support@myfitnesspal.com](mailto:support@myfitnesspal.com) for further help. Thank you!
"I think most, if not all calorie trackers would be good for weight gain. 

The one I use is cronometer, which let's you set your desired weight gained per week. Cronometer also let's you see the macro or micronutrients you might be missing in the free version.

I've heard only good things about macrofactor, but it does cost money (still less expensive than MyFitnessPal premium I believe)"
Thank you! Just created my cronometer account
"myfitnesspal does!

not many people know how to use this feature but if you go to more > settings > sharing & privacy > diary sharing > and set to friends only or public...you should be able to go to more > friends > click profile > and click diary icon

hope this helps :)"
i use lifesum
I like mfp and the abrcode thing still works for me.(I know many dont like mfp tho)
i like mynetdiary. i’ve tried a couple different ones including fatsecret and i like the configuration of netdiary best. you can customize it a lot which is nice and it’s visually pleasing.
I highly recommend [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/)!
cronometer
i used yazio and mynetdiary and they are both pretty good
"my fitness pal or lose it, imo especially if you’re outside the usa. both have crowdsourced info from users, so if you eat a lot of foods that are uncommon in western countries, these usually have at least some input in them! ofc you will need to doublecheck if it looks accurate etc."
"lose it is great, there’s also mynetdiary"
"[https://cronometer.com/](https://cronometer.com/) still has a free version with a lot of features (macro tracking, bar code scanner, etc)."
I use lifesum. Has a barcode scanner for free too
"Free Loseit has all of the features you need. But for $20 for a year… loseits premium features are nice and decently affordable. Tracking macros, nutritions strategies, planning meals days ahead, etc"
"i dont think lose it does that, but if u go over ur limit im pretty sure theres a bit of red on the bar"
Is loseit! superior to MyFitnessPal? I forget why I chose the latter but I'm willing to switch
"I have been using the free version of cronometer for a few months. I'm satisfied with it.

There are several other free options available for you to try out."
My all time favorite is lose it!
I know a lot of people use myfitnesspal but I personally use the Fitbit app which allows you to just input the calories if you want to as well as the option to search for food and scan barcodes etc
I like cronometer
I use lifesum. You can just enter amount of calories.
I got a Fitbit and it has its own calorie log system similar to myfitnesspal.
lose it!
"I looove lose it!! I tried my fitness pal, but lose it just worked better for me. I found it easier to log foods and set goals. Idk, just my 2 cents :)"
i use lifesum because i love the interface. my fitness pal is good it's just an eyesore
i’ve used both lose it and my fitness pal and i prefer lose it
"Lose it

Was using my fitness pal but like lose it best"
"My fitness pal or lose it are very simple and user friendly! my fitness pal for the minimalist, lost it is a little bit more fun. I also recommend carrot! this app is strict and a lot of fun. The AI interacts with you and you have an avatar that starts off as a skeleton, and becomes obese if you overeat."
I use lose it as well my fitness pal for me was too much ui wasn't as clean Imo
I use Glimmer app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loseit.glimmer
I switched to lose it from MFP a few months ago because I was so sick of how messy the my fitness pal app has become. I actually really like it.
"I used my fitness pal for a long time. It's intuitive and has a large selection of calorie counted food so it makes using it VERY easy. 

Hooewwweever I just recently started using lose it! And I love it!!! I like the layout better and the section of calorie counted food is still very good. I also love that it breaks up my calories into the different meals. So if I have a 400 cal breakfast it distributes my remaining calories to the other meals. So I know exactly how much I can/should eat for snacks and dinner."
"you can do these exact things on myfitnesspal. you just have to add each other as friends and make sure your diary settings are set of visible by friends. then you can go to each others log book for any day and view each others entry's 

as for recipes, you can also do that on myfitnesspal, its super simple"
"lose it allows barcodes and visual tracking of your weight loss. 
i also got a year premium for £13"
mynetdiary :)
lose it Fs
"Wait, is the app called ""loseit?"""
"Is the app called ""lose it!""? I was a bit confused i thought you were telling me not to use an app 😅"
"I have lose it too, you should type in the brand name instead of barcode scanning it. Most times you will find a grams/oz version. If not, just find a similar brand with the same amount of calories per serving that you see on the bag :)"
im talking about lose it not the product
"Oh, I would just use an entry in lose it that has grams as the option. If you can’t find one, you can create it. Or you could also do the math to covert the grams to pieces with the info from the label."
"I also just use the FitBit app/website.  I don't let it calculate my calorie needs based on my exercise; I tell it what my daily calorie goal is.  It doesn't have the bells and whistles that other apps have, but it works well for my purposes.  Because it allows user created entries, I usually double check against product packaging or USDA website and edit or create my own entries when necessary.

Other options are [Chronometer](https://cronometer.com/) and [LoseIt](https://www.loseit.com/).  

The specific app is less important than figuring out your [TDEE or maintenance calories](https://tdeecalculator.net/), and tracking well enough to be reasonably sure you're eating less than that on average each day.  As long as you eat less than your TDEE more days than not, you'll lose weight.  Good luck!"
"This is such a great start, and love thinking about this reverse. Can't wait to see how it progresses with either

1. simple food logging experience you integrate into the web page
2. or turned into a plug-in i can add into myfitnesspal"
"I just installed Lifesum a few days ago, and it's really neat. It's very simple and well designed, with none of that social media stuff myfitnesspal does."
I like lose it. I just wished it also had a weight gain/maintenance option even tho that defeats the purpose of the name 😭
"On r/loseit there are periodic challenges where you are put on a team that competes against other teams. Weight loss and fitness levels are tracked weekly for 6 weeks. You can use your Fitbit to log exercise and have the support of your team. It isn’t a competitive calorie counting app,  but you can regularly count your calories on whatever app you choose and then use that to assist in completion or competition between you cams your friend. 

Edit: a completion in starting soon if you are interested. An initial post will be made tomorrow with more info "
"I used to use fatsecret. Their search and food entry and meal creation functions were a lot more polished and complete than myfitnesspal. But the site's on life support, features breaking or disappearing, forums overrun with spam, and they deleted my account with all my diary and recipes and shit for complaining about it(but the russian gambling site ads and fake rolex and internet viagra and crypto scammers and so on posting every day stay up.) Definitely wouldn't recommend, it's not going to be there in five years."
"With apps like myfitnesspal or Cronometer they automatically count your macros, but I really only look at protein"
"I really like cronometer. They do include user submitted entries, but it seems that they hold true to reviewing them because I rarely find a deviation from the label on scanned items. MFP was all over the place for me, and I hated it."
"I use mfp but I'm terrible about tracking, lol. Lots of days I only put half what I eat in. If you don't ""complete the diary"" every day you won't get a warning/shut down. Just make your own profile and don't use the complete button."
i never got feedback from mfp even when sometimes i just didnt fill it out or partially did it lol
"You can do that in Chronometer! You have to have the pro version but one year is only 34.99$ (which for an app I use every single day felt worth it to me as there are other features offered I wanted like grouping of my foods and such)

Personally; I LOVE the app. Not quite as popular as myfitnesspal but I find the calorie counts to be more accurate and most entries have the option to enter the exact grams eaten instead of having to do a bunch of crazy math with converting your measured amount into the number of servings eaten like in most apps)

EDIT: you can also connect a variety of devices including your fitbit! I wanted to double check!"
"cronometer. you can use features that most apps make you pay for, from barcodes to macros to micronutrients, pretty user friendly too"
I use yazio
"I use fatsecret.com (and the app) and I don't find it convoluted and confusing.  I like can I can track carbs, fat, protein, sugar, sodium along with just calories.  I do wish it had a feature that I could manually add something - just xx calories for when I'm busy but then I would lose out on an accurate carb/fat/protein ratio."
"I use the ""myfitnesspal"" app on android."
I also use the calorie counter app by fatsecret.com and I have also wished I could just add some calories especially when the barcode scanner doesn't find the particular food item.
"Me too, I'm very fond of it! Caloriecounter (on the other hand) judges your food choices and I hate that. If I decide I'd prefer a higher fat lower carb/processed food diet, I'd rather not see that caloriecounter judges butter as a ""D"" food. But I have no complaints whatsoever about myfitnesspal."
You can add your own foods on the fatsecret.com website then they should be available in the mobile app.
"I should give that a try, sometimes i feel like i need some extra deterrent from sweets on account of perma-sweet tooth. 

Off the tip of my head, the only thing that I wish were different with mfp, was background syncing when you start the app instead of in the foreground. that's mainly because I don't use the website really, unless I'm putting in a recipe or something."
"You can add foods in the [LoseIt](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lose-it!/id297368629?mt=8) app (also [on Android](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.fitnow.loseit&hl=en), and [the web](http://www.loseit.com/) and you can also add recipes made up of other food items.  It has barcode scanning (and matching with foods you've added yourself or for some reason aren't properly matched automatically).  It interfaces with FitBit, like MyFitnessPal, and generally has worked pretty well for me."
"I weigh and record each ingredient to get macros for the finished product. 

I then divide this by the weight of the finished meal so that I have calories/fat/protein/carbs per gram and use this as the serving information in myfitnesspal.

Then weigh each meal and record."
cronometer for sure. best macro and nutrient tracking out there.
lose it is the best!!
+2 lose it
Looove my net diary!
I use loseit and I love it
Seconding cronometer!
Fourthing free cronometer!
2nd lose it
Cronometer. All food entries are reviewed or come from government databases. I’ve found other apps like loseit to be wildly inaccurate and unreliable.
I feel like I bought lose it lifetime cz they kept promoting it but regretting it now.
I am confused on what exactly you are looking for. I'm pretty sure myfitnesspal has a Hindi language option. My guess would be that most of the big players have that.
"Tbh tracking Indian food is a bit hard since everyone makes the dishes differently - I'm guju but I put way less sugar in my dal than many of my friends who are guju

I typically like to use cronometer and create personal recipes in there for tracking kcals"
"I like **cronometer**, the free options are great and nothing necessary is behind a paywall. A lot of people use **lose it**, I use lose it whenever I don't have Internet for an extended period of time because it has a pretty good offline database. I prefer to use cronometer because I feel like it has a lot of free options that lose it makes you pay for."
I use mynetdiary. No ads but it will prompt to join their subscription every so often. Has a lot of foods already in their catalog which is super helpful!
"I really like mynetdiary, but I don't like how they calculate how many calories you need to lose x pounds per week.  I use cronometer to calculate my calories and enter that number into mynetdiary

I think it's my favorite calorie counting app I've ever used, even compared to lose it before they made their barcode scanner premium"
"The short version is that they use a different equation than the tdee calculator that this sub recommends.  I like to use the sedentary option for my tdee at maintenance, and for the cico sub determination, that comes out to 2405, but mynetdiary's comes out to 2901.  It's a huge difference, and I maintain at 2405 and gain very quickly at 2900"
My barcode scanner on my net diary along with my food scale makes it SO easy. Not sure I could do it without
"i use lifesum and maybe i’m just used to it since it’s the only one i’ve ever used long term, but i appreciate the layout of it and how user friendly it is"
same. just switched to macrofactor last week and it’s superior to myfitnesspal. love it.
I used to use the my fitness pal premium but I recently switched toto lose it premium. I have it connected to my watch. I like both apps but so far I’m finding I like the lose it app better. I hope you find what works the best for you. They are both good apps.
"Just started using lose it, and it seems pretty good, but I've been using my macros + for years and it's great."
Don't pay for a calorie tracker. You can get what you need for free. One example is cronometer
I use loseit
"I like lose it 
It’s very intuitive"
yazio :)
I use lose it and just search for the item by name. they are usually in there and you don't have to use the barcode.
"Bar code scans have been off. It happens too frequently for me to see the barcode element as a ""feature"".

I take a picture of food item or ingredient on a scale and end up at the end of the day. I also pre- plan my meals by 1-4 weeks. I source my calorie info from current packaging or looking up the food item via google USDA's info. 

If I forget to take a picture I just write down what it was and the grams in my notepad app.

I only use the apps if I am reviewing my macros or building a new meal/recipe or dish anymore. I use MyFitnessPal but always find errors in food. I keep meaning to download cronometer or loseit and replace myfitnesspal but just havent. 

Sitting down once a month and preplanning meals made me really not give a floop about apps. It is good as a learning tool, but not really needed for the long run once you get your new habits sorted."
"I bought a lifetime to lose it which is basically free if you use it for the next 40 years but yeah chronometer is the only one left with barcode scanning free, and I suspect even they will fall soon"
"I use Cronometer, the free version has everything you need to get you started and it's very user friendly. Every food in their database is correct as everything on there is pre approved as opposed to myfitnesspal for example where you will find a million entries for the same food by different users, often wrong so you need to double check everything."
I nearly blew a gasket building a recipe min the lose it app.  I know it can be done but I got super frustrated and gave up!
Agreed. I have lose it as others mentioned and like it but if you want alll the data - cronometer
"I'm using fatsecret. Pretty barebones but thanks to that it's simple to use. I add recipes and add the finished weight for portions so it's easy to log. 

But it usually takes some time because it's probably US based so products and brands are different so you have to change measurements to hit the same calories."
I heard you can change your location to Canada and features return to lose it.
"I’ve been using [lose it!](https://www.loseit.com/) for 10 years
It give you a daily limit, based on your info and how much weight you want to lose in a week 0.5-2lbs 
In the 10 years I’ve only used the free version."
"I love Macros, you can customize it a lot more than myfitnesspal but it's clear and not cluttered"
"I really wanted to use lose it as it's what my wife uses but I hate what I can't input foods for the future.

I meal prep and I love being able to enter my lunches for the entire work week"
"I found a solution to that as I’ve been using lose it free for a couple months. 

Enter the meal and save it as a recipe for your serving and then you can just enter that into your log the next day. 

Just do it under whatever area is empty to create it and then there’s an option to clear it all after you finish."
"I don't use MFP, too inaccurate, and they don't track any nutrients, I use cronometer. It gives a breakdown for every nutrient."
I use loseit because I got a trial and it worked for me. If this app didn’t work mfp is my next one to try. I tried weight watchers but it didn’t work well for me.
My fitness pal for me but lose it seemed just as good. I just started with MFP so stuck with it.
Do you pay on lose it or is it free?
"Nah, doesn't loseit not even track protein grams? I was stunned to learn that last week.  Sure, not everyone cares how much calcium or folate they get, but no protein?"
"Yes, you can track all macros for free on lose it.

You can track daily protein, carbs and fats, swipe left on calorie tab 

You can also track all macros per meal if you click on the title of each meal, “breakfast” “lunch” and “dinner”… I think a lot of people don’t realize this, too."
"In my opinion, there isn't anything out there better than MacroFactor. Devs are active on reddit in r/macrofactor and there's regular updates and improvements to the app. It takes an adherence neutral approach and calculates your expenditure to an absurd level of accuracy. Largest RD verified database and stuff like AI describe where you literally talk your recipe to the app and it autocreates the recipe. You can also copy and paste recipes from the Internet into it as well. I've lost 15kg with it. Genuine game changer. Its paid but worth every since penny"
"Can't go past cronometer. Every item is staff screened, has an option for grams, and they have impressive vitamin and mineral tracking/breakdown."
"I like when the data is hidden away and I can get reports. Like, on cronometer it's easy to enter stuff, but I can tap through to see nutrient reports and breakdowns of them."
"i used loseit and while it is a little annoying, just like anything once you make a habit of utilizing it while cooking and weighing it really becomes second nature. Keep at it!"
Congrats to the amazing progress! I hope you’re feeling better and your injury is healing! The link to your yazio thing wasn’t working unfortunately 🫠 I use the same app ☺️
"Thanks a lot! I'm on week 2 of physiotherapy and beginning to start walking outside again! For what regards running doctors told me to wait a couple of months and do low impact exercises instead 💪🏽 
Gosh! I thought the link was the same as 2 weeks ago, this should work! https://to.yazio.com/pH951"
I love lose it! They have more measurement units and overall its extremely user friendly
I paid for lose it premium for a year and switched back to MFP. Lose it is pretty but I just prefer MFP for some reason
Thank you 🙂 so you found lose it to have a prettier interface but MFP just became habit
"Thank you, I'm in the position and was wondering if I should make the shift but also the faff around disconnecting apps and reconnecting to lose it"
I use fat secret. It’s free and pretty decent:) happy counting! Cheers
I like loseit.
"Yes, cronometer is orders of magnitude better. All the entries are correct, and they all offer grams.

Your TDEE is about  2500, so yeah, 2250 is a bit high. Did you tell it you were exercising? Your BMR is 2200 even if you are 18, so whatever you are entering into sites is wrong."
I use yazio. I'm from Germany and they have a pretty big data bank of german products that I couldn't find with other apps. So depending on where you're from this could be helpful
i also use loseit but the free version and can confirm the barcode scanner is free :)
I use cronometer everyday. I have my Fitbit linked to it. Just input every calorie and I set it to lose 1.5 pounds a week. I just eat exactly what it tells me I can and I actually lose 1.5 a week. It’s really cool
"I've tried my fitness pal, lose it, and chronometer and I always come back to my fitness pal.  I find it the simplest to use.  Others have fancier interfaces but there's just a lot more going on that I either don't need or just make navigating around more confusing.  I also didn't like that lose it makes you pay for premium in order to connect to a fitness tracker.  That may or may not be relevant to you, but there's that."
"I am extremely happy with https://www.fatsecret.com/ for many years now. Nearly everything you need is free, just pre-made recipes, water tracking and meal plans and so on are behind a Premium subscription (you can of course still pre-log and make your own recipes and use user made recipes)."
"So I went through a phase about three months ago when my premium subscription of myfitnesspal expired where I tried all the main ones (lose it, cronometer, macrofactor, etc.).

I ultimately settled with lose it and purchased a lifetime sub for $60 after one month of their normal month to month subscription. Loseit has all the features you really need (scanner, macros, large food database) but the main reason I liked it is that it can scan labels and autofill nutrient information. It's been a lifesaver when a barcode doesn't come up with anything.

I will say though that I absolutely loved my one week trial of macrofactor and if only it was cheaper, I'd have subscribed."
"loseit! you log daily, but if you pull down the top bar you can see weekly!! it's nice if certain days are higher but you can still see you're under for the week! i love it"
"Google fit syncs with lose it. You can tell Google fit you started ""strength training"" and when to stop then lose it gives you how many calories it thinks you should burn strength training in an hour. Is it precise? No. If I wasn't losing weight despite a the app showing deficit I would probably stop counting exercise calories."
"i use my apple watch ultra 2 and lose it. lose it doesn't automatically give me every calorie the watch says i burned during an exercise back, it uses the total estimate of calories burned from the watch over the entire day.

two weeks ago i ate 1700 calories over maintenance, according to my tracking and what the apple watch said i burned (i didn't intentionally eat every single exercise calorie back, but i wasn't really trying all that hard to stay under my goal either). 1700 calories says i should have gained roughly 0.5 lb. my actual weight over those seven days went up 0.6 lb.

almost everyone in this sub continues to parrot the idea that all wearables are useless to all people on earth for tracking calories out...i'm here to say that's not necessarily the case. don't eat all of your exercise calories back all the time if you're trying to lose, but also eating some of them back isn't going to destroy all of your progress as some here would have you believe.

earlier today i had this argument with someone on this sub who said that if he ate his exercise calories back, he'd ""quickly be 400 lbs"" which is absurd, unless he's already 399 lbs."
"Curious, does the Fitbit data strip the bmr data before it sends it to the lose it app?  I’m pretty sure Fitbit also includes bmr calories when you record exercise.  That’s why I don’t link that data  with my Nutracheck app.  I use the apps far more accurate estimated numbers and eat it all back if I want to"
"So if lose it taking in account your activity level before it receives the Fitbit data, does it remove the same amount of calories (or not record it) until you go over and above the number it is expecting?"
"i use samsung health, and sometimes cronometer"
"The loseit app allows you to take pictures of the barcode and the nutrition info, see if that helps you"
“lose it!” Let’s you do that.
"I created a custom food in cronometer. I set it so 1 gram of ""manual entry"" equals 1 calorie. I use it for a couple of places that have nutrition info not in the app, but I don't feel like creating all the things individually. IIRC Myfitnesspal (and probably many of the others) also lets you create custom foods, so you could do the same."
"BTW The myfitnesspal app also lets you scan barcodes.

There's also an item named ""calorie"" in the food database that has 1 calorie.  So you can just add those if you don't want to track food.

And remember you should also track your water to make sure you're getting 8 cups per day!"
"I use nutracheck after trialing lose it, my fitness pal and ntracheck. Was checking in on all three and stopped the ones i had more issues with."
"I have used MFP, lose it, and chronometer.  I like MFP best.  The interface on the other two are definitely nicer, but MFP shows me more of what I want to see in a simple way.  

I liked how chronometer showed me more of my micronutrients but I really disliked my food not being separated out into meals.  The downside of it not having as many user entries for food was that it means some foods, like restaurant stuff, wasn't in there.  I know MFP user entries can be inaccurate but I've had no problems just searching for a food and choosing something in the mid-high average and going with that.  Still consistently losing weight even on weeks we do a lot of take out.

I tried lose it but was immediately turned off that I had to buy premium to connect to my fitness tracker.  It's free with other apps and I don't want to spend $30 just to get my exercise in there.  I'd rather pay for premium MFP to unlock some extra features if I'm going to spend money.  

Chronometer was overwhelming with all the different graphs and things.  I didn't find most of them terribly interesting or helpful for my fitness goals, so I just ignored them.

There was this really cool weekly report I've seen people post on here from lose it and I really wanted it, but apparently it depends on the version of the app you get based on your phone operating system and I can't get it on my phone.  MFP has a similar report (weekly calorie goal versus daily) so I get what I need anyway. 

After trying all the main apps I'm an MFP person."
But on cronometer it's free
fatsecret
"The simplest one is an excel sheet but it's not necessarily the simplest to use depending on how you like logging your meals.

Cronometer, loseit are both handy apps that work well. Someone mentioned Yaizo here a while back so you may give it a shot and see if ti works for you."
"I've noticed that mfp, and carb manager, have one thing in common. They will both pound you to upgrade to premium. Incessantly, everyday, every session. Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade. I get so tired of it."
"I like loseit.  
I think it's cuter.  
Also it doesn't look HORRIBLE when you go over. That's something I hated about MFP- I felt like a horrible failure because the numbers were big and red haha It still gives you and estimate of when you will lose weight that will change as you stick to your calories or not overall rather than ""in five weeks"" idk I just kinda like it better. I tried it and stayed :)"
"I've used mfp before, but I switched over to LoseIt! because I like the layout better and some of the features
"
I use mfp too. Check out loseit. Report back for the rest of us!
"MyFitnessPal ! Try different apps and suit yourself of course, but i like the professional design of mfp, i love the stats section, how good customer support is, but most importantly if you’re not from the US or europe other apps wont have the brands your country has, or i cant find traditional / ethnic dishes on loseit, there arent enough options. while in MFP you can find pretty much any food."
I really like loseit. 
"I like lose it as well. I even upgraded to do the water intake and it included to track other things like my blood pressure and nutrients. You can even change the theme, I chose beach, which is fun 🏖 "
I move away from myfitnesspal to  mynetcalorie.  A lot more features and almost no advertisement.
If im awake its still the same day. I dont track my calories on an app I just write down what calories im at each time I eat in my notes on my phone. Looking up food and all that jaz takes to long easier just to open notes put in 480 and close it. After each day I delelte the number from the day before and enter in the calories from the current day.
Thank you! 😊 I figured it out thankfully. I used the recipe function on the lose it app.
i dug around for macros tracking apps that don't show calories with no luck. i will try cronometer tho!
"thank you thank you, this is exactly what i'm asking for! amazing! you're the second person to recommend cronometer, i will try it out for sure😊"
I use myfitnesspal. When I actually stick to my calories and don't binge eat it works great.
"Cronometer is more intuitive the mfp imho. Try them all, as they are free to try."
"Get a tracker like cronometer where you can add in recipes, so when you’re doing your meal prep you can put all the ingredients from the recipe into one place and it will calculate the total. Then when you are eating it , weigh the portion and then you’ll get the estimated calories."
No its actually mynetdiary
"You can open the Apple Health app and search for nutritional energy (kcals eaten). If your loseit data shows there, it should also successfully load in Count.kcal. If it doesn‘t, that would mean loseit does not save data there. In that case, you should check in loseit settings."
"Aah, I hope there's a good Dutch one you can use! I found things like myfitnesspal really frustrating because there was so little local food in it, and if you searched by name you'd get an American one that just didn't relate to the UK counterpart.  I hope you can find one!"
Is this an app issue? I don’t use lose it I just use an app that lets me log what I eat. I dunno it seems like you’re making a huge deal out of nothing 🤷🏻‍♂️
I prefer lose It over my fitness pal. I think the library is way larger and I like the extra things in the app mfp didn’t offer
Check out loseit! MFP is great to but I find loseit more visually appealing.
I like lose it over myfitnesspal
I am so proud of you 🥹 i gained 40 pounds in 2 months in a depressed state and now that i am better ive been shedding the pounds with lose it as well!
It gets harder and harder as you have less to lose. I’m only trying to lose 20 lbs of regain and it’s slow going at 1200 cals on Saxenda. When I had 100 to lose it flew off.
"That is awesome!!! Go you! I have lost 80 and I have 9 more to go until I hit my goal weight of 160 and I seriously feel you. These last 9 seem harder than the 80 I've already lost. They don't want to budge! I also use lose it too. Good luck, we will get them off one way or another! 💪"
"I work a swing shift.  12 hour days one week 12 hrs nights next week.   I just use my wake period as the day on my app.  Down 45 pounds and been on swing shift for 15 years.   It works

I use loseit app so I'm just like well 24hr period starts when I wake up.   I shift everything around.   You get used to it when you find what works.  I end up eating a little extra the first night I work and go a little under he last night I work because of how I sleep. 

Just remember cico works on a 24hr period.   Doesn't really matter how you shift them around."
Meal prep if you can? And input it in an app like lose it!
"When I worked nights, I would log my first meal as dinner, and then anything after as a snack. Once it was past midnight, if I had a meal it was counted as breakfast/lunch and I used all the snacks options on loseit to keep track of when I was eating. I equated the meal titles with time of eating rather than order of eating. 

So one day would be like 

Early snack (1-2 am), breakfast (4 am), lunch(7-8 am), SLEEP afternoon snack(4-5 pm), dinner(9-10 pm), and then it's midnight so it starts over. It was the easiest way for me to make sense of it."
"I prefer lose it over my fitness pal. I can see overall weekly trends and it helps me track calories over the week rather than just daily. So if I go over on one day, I can see how much I’ve been under that week and it always reassures me. I’ve never had any issues finding any UK food on it. 

Good luck!"
I dig loseit and would recommend! There constantly updating layout and stuff but i still found them easiest to deal with.
"well myfitnesspal is the most common free calorie and macro tracking app for sure...its pretty easy to use but could most certainly be better for the amount of users it has. 

if anyone has any better suggestions feel free to drop em"
I used to use fat secret.
"the only truly free app i know is called waistline. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waist.line&gl=US&pli=1

it is fully opensource, they will never ask for any kind of money. the other apps can remove wihout much warning features you like behind a paywall. 

you can get your own usda api and enter it on the app and has bar scanner etc. 

the other 'free' version, loseit, chronometer, etc make a commodity out of you, you don't mind watching ads, ok fair, but they are making money on you. they are not privacy friendly. 

you may say you don't have anything to hide? do you close your curtains when you change clothes or lock your door when you go out?"
"Use the recipe function in your tracking app. Log all the ingredients and use the total weight of the cooked food as your recipe size. Someone else already tried to explain. If you use the lose it app, you can change recipe size from X number of servings to X grams for recipe weight. In My Fitness Pal you cant change it to grams but you can still call it 3,500 servings (however many grams there are).  THEN, when you take your portion, you weigh how many grams you’re taking and the app does the math for you.

Edited for multiple typos"
My understanding is that WW has a lot of zero point foods and they expect you to fill your day with those. I use the lose it app and it’s worked well for me since CICO makes sense to me and it is something I should be able to sustain without the app. A housemate has been using WW and we had a moment where we both went to log a small hostess dessert item which was only 160 calories but 9 points on their app. It works for some people but that level of restriction (with the bad foods vs good foods) doesn’t work for me. Good luck with finding what works best for you!
"I had really good success on the WW smart points system back in 2016, but they have since changed it. I have tried once or twice since then and did not do well. Started doing CICO with the lose it app and was able to lose what I wanted without any fancy points or cost!"
whats the difference between loseit and my fitness pal if you dont mind sharing
"I hate all the apps and the adds. I use track by nutritionix and it’s so easy and convenient to count compared to everything else I had used (Noom, mfp, Loseit, and more). The database might be a little smaller but in reality it’s the tracking that makes me be honest and within reason.  So a basic food journal might do the same for me."
"But I was always healthy. I have never been unhealthy. My food choices, for the most part, are super similar to what they were before. And before, I'd still lose the weight 'naturally' by being careful and mindful, perhaps a little more slowly, but I'd tend to lose it. For me, the biggest change is the mental part and that's also the part that I feel ambivalent about."
"It is nice and simple but missing a few things that I use all the time on loseit.


1.  Recipes - I eat the same homemade things alot and not being able to create recipes makes that more work to log.


2.  How quantities are added.   Now, when you hit the plus button a food is added by serving.   To edit the amount I need to select the food from the log, edit it and then I can only edit the serving portion.   I would just like to be able to enter grams and have it happen in the process of adding the food, not after the fact."
Great work guys! Sadly this comes like 3 weeks after I paid for a lifetime to lose it lmao but this is awesome for anyone not wanting to spend
"looks interesting, but one thing i love about lose it that i don't think i can go without now is the ability to look at a weekly view quickly and easily. i set up my week based on the idea of being under my goal sun-wed and slightly over on thurs-fri-sat, as long as my week overall ends up at or near goal. it looks like from the current UI it's going to be too hard for me to track in that manner."
"I know it costs an arm and a leg for access to the nutrition label library. Do you have access to the same thing MFP, Carbon, loseit are using or is your info coming from elsewhere?"
"Just randomly found this app after googling to see if MFP and lose it still have the barcode scanner behind a paywall. I am super happy with it so far, thank you for your hard work!! ❤️"
"we currently only use fatsecret API, but we plan to expand.

and my roommate is working on micronutrient previews right now! we will add micro goals in the next update if we can’t do it in this one, but at the very least you will be able to see the micronutrients for each food"
we are using fat secrets API
"1. On loseit you can make a recipe (say a pot if soup) and define to total recipe quantity  (say 2000g).  then if you serve yourself 200g of soup you get 1/10th of the nutrition in the pot and it shows up as one item in the log, not as separate ingredients it does here.  

Also.i think your log should show the measurement quantity as well as calories."
I am not the original commenter but my favorite thing about lose it is that the calories from lose it automatically get input into my Fitbit app and the calories burned from my Fitbit get reflected in lose it. I assume that’s what they mean
"yup, i’ll take a look tonight. could you also DM me a screenshot of how it looks when you use it in loseit? thanks!"
"That looks good :)
I use the servings field in mfp to store the number of hundreds of grams in the recipe. So if the final product is 2.5kg, I enter 25  in the servings. Then when I eat, say 350g, I add 3.5 servings."
"I prefer cronometer. I tried my fitness pal and lose it but I just didn't find them as straightforward as cronometer is and you can scan barcodes and see micro/macro nutrient %'s without needing to pay extra. 

I also didn't like, can't remember which one it was, that one of them was flagging things as good or bad towards my deficit. But it would kick out random info that wasn't helpful but just fit the algorithm it was running on."
"I really like loseit. Maybe it's silly, but the cute little icons of the food make me happy!"
I like cronometer
I tried my fitness pal like 3 times and always ended up quitting after 24 hours. Been using lose it for over a month now
I started w MfP and just became a habit. I tried switching but found MFP had a bigger database so it saved me time from entering stuff in. I like mynetdiary bc of ux is nicer and it’s easier to input per gram sometimes but they don’t have a huge database. And someone here promoted their app fitbee but again the database is what kept me on MFP.
I’ve always used mfp like on and off since 2012. UK seems to get the barcode reader for free and the database is good for the foods I want and all my recipes.
"It’s advertising. And also unwillingness to change.
I use MFP and I love it.
I have seen enough in this subreddit to know lose it is probably a little bit better.
But I have made great progress while using MFP.
I have already downloaded it, Given them my card details and input meal info, so changing would be a hassle.
MFP pays a lot of money for advertising and as a result is usually the first to mind that people come across, so they download and stick with it. 
It’s the same as banks and lots of other businesses. People are lazy (hence why we need to lose weight!!) 
Use whatever works !"
"I’m in Australia and didn’t mind MFP, but I like lose it or my net diary waaaaaaay better!"
"I use myfitnesspal because I’ve been using it for so long. Once out of curiosity I was using myfitnesspal and losing it at the same time. The calories count was almost the same,
I liked the layout and feel of losing it but hated  that I couldn’t use a decimal point. 🤷‍♀️"
I use cronometer.  I like seeing micro & macro nutrients
I prefer the lose it app personally.
"When MFP got bought and started trying to pump more money out of me, I switched to loseit."
Idk I've used a couple deffrent apps mfp is what I'm currently using but  like it but it's probably just because I'm used to it I used my plate app for a while as well
I used myfitnesspal for a year but I went back to lose it. I prefer the way they are set up. I was premium on both of the apps. Lose it was my preference years ago. I switched back once my premium subscription expired on my fitness pal. I’m not sure why it is preferred over lose it but they both work. Probably just personal preference.
"My fitness pal was the OG. When calorie counting first became popularized (instead of things like gluten free, low fat, paleo etc) that was the only one out there that had your basic food dairy, meal entry, and barcode scanner. It was on your phone and easy to do.

I didn’t calorie count again for years but when I picked it back up again, I tried lose it based off a video I had seen on tiktok. It’s much easier to use, and the free version has pretty much all you need!"
I love lose it! MFP’s blue look made it feel medical to me haha
I’m using mfp only because it used to be the one with the biggest data base of Australian foods and I tried others but the familiarity of mfp has me staying with it
"I have tried several apps. Off the top of my head:


* Lose It


* Fitbit (I think)


* Chronometer


* MyFitnessPal


* Macrofactor (currently using this)


* Probably more, been tracking for a while




Lose It


I didn't like lose it because the ads felt obnoxious and I didn't like that it would show red when I ate over my daily calorie limit and I believe it would show weekly calories and that was getting me in the habit of trying to ""make up"" for eating over my calories one day by eating less the next. Also, I found a large number of really incorrect entries when I used it.


Note: I use Lose It a *loooong*  time ago.


Fitbit


I *hated* that it would automatically add back calories based on what it thought I burned. My calories burned was always wrong. And I do not believe that you could turn off that feature at the time.


Chronometer


Honestly don't exactly remember why I didn't like that one but I believe that I just didn't feel like the UI was intuitive to me. It looked fine, I just didn't like clicking through do do what I needed.




MyFitnessPal


I literally only stopped using it because they put the barcode scanner behind a paywall and I figured if I was going to pay for a product, I would pay for a better one.




Macrofactor (what I currently use)


UI is intuitive, has a barcode scanner, no screaming Yay or anything at me. I just want something to hold my numbers and be fast and easy to use. It does have the feature of adjusting calories based on how much weight you are losing (or gaining if that is your goal). I just don't need that feature because I do the math on paper and am always within 100 calories of what it calculated any way. But it can be handy for someone who does not want to do that math."
"I just stumbled upon Calory and I really like it over MFP, lose it etc… for the simple reason that it is soooo streamlined. Sleek, no fuss, modern app. The one thing I could never stand was all the extra “stuff”. Tracking alone was enough to hurt my brain, I didn’t need the visual clutter 😵‍💫"
"I use lifesum, Ive never seen someone else use it, but it’s my fav!"
I prefer macrofactor
Tbh I think macrofactor is best. I stopped using MFP when the barcode scanner became premium.
"Lose it is by far better. I frequently look at Reddit before I buy things in order to get a more realistic idea about things. Not to say there isn’t some hidden marketing dressed up as organic posts.

The problem with a lot of websites and blogs is that they’re essentially designed to create a passive income , which means that those top ten lists (especially around xmas time ) are very much affiliate websites. The site gets paid for you clicking the link. 

I expect that mfp pay better per click"
I LOVE the Lose It app.  My friend was using both MFP and Lose it at the same time to see which one she liked better and she also ended up settling on lose it.  She was using the paid versions of both.
They offered me “lose it for life” for 60 bucks.
"I love cronometer. Especially in love lately with the ""add recipe"" button bc I can just scan all the items in and set a serving size and It'll do all the heavy lifting calculations for me."
I love it so much it’s SO useful for macros. The free version is on par with the paid version of mfp
"(This answer is a bit rambly sorry!)

Haha, I do get what they're aiming for with trying to highlight patterns that help individuals succeed at weight loss etc but it just made me dislike the app. 


I think its because I don't want an app telling me or even ""gently implying"" what I should and shouldn't eat to lose weight, all I want is an app to track what I eat so I can stay below maintenance overall and lose weight ha. 


So I'm sure for some people that would be a wonderful feature and I hope it works well for you :). 


I downloaded all three (mfp, lose it and cronometer) and was going to log in all of them simultaneously for a few days but after the first day I realised which one worked for me. 


They are all surprisingly different from each other, I didn't think a tracking app could be that varied but clearly was wrong ha"
"I'm in the UK :). For anything it doesn't know I just scan it and either take a photo of the nutrition label and it auto enters the numbers it reads or I just add it myself. Most of the stuff I have is on there now. It has a surprising amount of UK stuff, e.g from the supermarkets here so it's a shame it sounds like it's not been populated much with entries from other parts of Europe. 


The only stuff it tends to not recognise are things that are random allergy friendly foods that I buy. But once I've entered them it remembers them fine :). 

For the meat etc I just double checked the numbers on the food packaging and found an entry that matched the per 100g amount on the packs I buy or at least one that was close enough and then reuse that saved entry for that item each time I have it. 

I hope you find one that does work for you and fingers crossed cronometer gets more data that is useful to you :)."
Interesting I might have to have a look I’ve never really looked into anything else because I’ve been using mfp for so long.
I have had premium since 2010!  I seem to lose it and then gain 1/4-1/2 of it back and get back on track.
"You probably have most regular things already saved in mfp so won't see much benefit.

Nutracheck is actually quite well made, but there is a major annoyance with it needing internet all the time - there were a few situations where there was no Internet and I had to record stuff in notes elsewhere to transfer later, tricky with QR codes.

Also I think mfp is better for holidays in Europe, but I tend not to track while on holiday so not really a problem."
Can absolutely see that it's a personal preference thing :) loads of people really rate lose it so I'm sure it's just me being picky haha.
"Same here, I also got lifetime for $50. I had to wait about 8 months into my first year of $19.99 premium. There were other sales before and may have been down to $50 but I think it was my third “lifetime sale” promotion that it was $50. 

I used my fitness pal and lose it concurrently for a year (free vs free) before I bought my yearly on lose it. I had previously used my fitness pal for 5-6 years until they pulled the free barcode scanner."
"I'm using fatsecret💁‍♀️ I don't know if all apps do this, but all posts I see are those from my country, so it's nice reading about familiar brands, struggles and stuff"
"I don’t use Cronometer for tracking exercise calories because I find it super random and I never know which level of intensity to pick. 

*But* I’m also quite active and didn’t really know how to enter that into cronometer to arrive at a useful calorie goal, so I used [this spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4mhvpn/adaptive_tdee_tracking_spreadsheet_v3_rescue/) to find out my actual TDEE, which obviously includes calories burnt exercising. If you already have calorie and weight data for a few weeks it should be pretty easy to fill out. I’ve found it gets pretty close to accurate after about 8 weeks, and obviously more accurate the more data you give it."
"I like the free version of [FatSecret.](https://fatsecret.com/) Visually, it is clean with no pop-ups, ads, or pitches to upgrade to paid. The app interface works better for me than Chronometer or LoseIt. 


 The free version  has  bar code scanning, daily and weekly summaries of 14 macros/nutrients,  ability to pre-plan days, save meals, track weight, etc. I'm told it has a good international database of foods. [It's the API behind Amazon, FitBit, Lifescan, Samsung, etc.](https://platform.fatsecret.com/api/)"
"
YES

The free reports feature in mine gives daily, week to date, and weekly totals. You can also set **different targets for different  days.**


It is the free version of [FatSecret.](https://fatsecret.com/) Visually, it is clean with no pop-ups, ads, or pitches to upgrade to paid.

"I used my fitness Pal last year but it is so dated looking and harder to use than lose it, lose it is way more modern and visual"
i think mfp has a larger food database so it’s easier to use
I've used my fitness pal for a year and I just switched to lose it this week. I find it much better and wish I'd compared them sooner.
"I use mynetdiary. All of the logging / weight tracking is free currently, but there is a subscription option for things like autopilot calories and recipe saving."
"FatSecret still has a free scanner. I ran FatSecret and cronometer simultaneously for a week or so, and I landed on FatSecret for myself. I miss the old mfp before shareholder and corporate greed took over."
I love cronometer.  I use the paid version but used the free for a while before I upgraded.  I love that they use the NCCDB calorie counts and doesn't rely on some people's custom counts.  I've literally seen a bacon guacamole burger from Red Robin listed as 400kcals on MFP and it was someone's custom entry.  That doesn't happen on Cronometer that I've seen.
"I’ve been in this sub for years and this post made me realize it’s not a sub for people who use the lose it app 

I use the lose it app, it’s not the best but it’s easy to use and I lost 90 pounds with it. I’ve used it on and off for 10 years and have never paid a dime. I always eat back my calories from exercise. It’s my little “reward” for exercising that day. The lose it app automatically loads my exercise calories from my Apple Watch."
"Chronometer completely redid the front-end of their website and app and it is so much better than it was previously IMO. That being said, I paid for lifetime loseit premium and like it a lot as well."
"If you aren't paying for it, either you are the product, or they are trying to drive you to pay for it.  Meaning they will withhold features to the paid tier, and the paid tiers will actually be subsidizing the free users.  MFP is expensive because the paid users have to support all the free users + be profitable.

I found lose it premium to be worth it for the price, affordable and good for what you get. I use MacroFactor now, which has a fair price and no free tier, so they develop the app to be the best for everyone that uses it."
"Myfitnesspal UI was my favorite of all the free calorie apps. 

Really hated using loseit/cronometer/etc.

MFP was the fastest to categorize, input meals, search for ingredients, and swap quickly between cups/spoons and ounces/pounds/grams.  I also liked the recipe feature for meal prepping.

However, I don't count calories anymore."
I use myfitnesspal but switched the region to United Kingdom and that made the scanner free again.
lifesum
New here but yazio looks super promising got all the juicy free stuff
"I don’t know if I’m losing my mind but I can’t find it in my App Store

Edit: just kidding! It’s called calorie counter by cronometer! Thank you for this, I’ve been hoping to find a new one since my fitness pal took away the barcode scanner as a free option"
Second for loseit! The way they divide up calories per meal has been so helpful. And better user interface than MFP.
Also use lose it. Some time ago I was offered a lifetime subscription for $100 and snagged that up. Totally worth it.
Currently like this app over lose it. Love the apple visuals 🍏
"I pay for premium too! It's been very helpful. Also, if you have taken a dna test (myancestry for example) you can upload it to lose it and it helps curate your goals based on genetic markers!"
"Do not bring political topics or discussion into /r/loseit 

Stay on topic of OPs weight journey, the pictures, or the original poster's comments. Keep political debate to other subreddits regardless of your intention. Do not derail conversation."
"I used to use lose it, redownloaded and it is not free... :("
"Hold on wait a minute, are you telling me this subreddit isn't named after the loseit app? I've been on here close to 2 years under the assumption it was for users of that app. I guess the more you know lol"
"I've been using cronometer for years and love it. 

But I had a playstore gift card at the time I got it and got a paid version so I don't know if the scanning feature is available in the free version. You could give it a try!"
"I have loseit premium and it's fine. I'm trying macrofactor at the moment but that's only available as a paid app.

Not sure if I will stick with it.

I did like MFP recipe feature and miss that 

But with Lose It I would just say watch the setting with the fitbit info. There is a feature that feeds over your activity so you ""earn"" more calories and I did not realize it at first and had to turn it off as it was throwing off my tracking. Of course some people may like to see that."
"I like macrofactor, although it is a paid app"
"I moved to loseit rightt after the announcement they were charging for barcodes and I find it much better to use. I like the UI more as well as the search, and the barcode scanner felt quicker."
"Used MFP a while ago, but now I'm using fatsecret free version and so far I don't see it lacking any features that I would want."
I use lose it. Free if you don’t press premium.
I moved to loseit and don't regret it. Cronometer was also an option but I hated that I can't differentiate breakfast/lunch/dinner etc. Bought the yearly membership at a discount and it's been really worth it for me. Love the little emojis and the little tips it gives me.
I’m enjoying loseit and don’t miss mfp. Haven’t felt the need to go premium yet.
loseit! i changed because of mfp aswell and actually prefer it
I've used the paid version of loseit for my whole weight loss journey and I would recommend it.
cronometer
I got lose it and paid for a year of premium for $20. Just from this thread alone it seems like lots of people have done the same!
"Chronometer has been WONDERFUL. They make it easy to use and add new foods if they aren't there plus they have barcode scanning.

My two problems are that you can't group food items into meals and you cannot import recipes from the Internet, meaning you have to input each item individually, both items are behind a paywall. It's working well enough without them for me. If I want to pay it's also cheaper for a lifetime subscription than mfp"
I’ve used lose it for years and like it a lot better than mfp.  The scanner is free btw.
"I can't use the Fitbit one, I legit do not understand how it works, it doesn't just give you an amount to eat, like hi please don't tell me I'm 300kcal over limit cause I had Weetabix wtf? Don't get it, don't understand how other people manage it, I tried loseit but it doesn't have a good EU database so the barcode is useless, tried two others, one I immediately yeetem on principle because it told me to eat 1000 kcal a day to lose 1lb a week (hi that's below min and also my TDEE is 1800+ normally), the other one I tried was ok but by the time I had been through them all I was so frustrated I deleted all three and went back to mfp 🙃"
"I have just started my journey and my fitness pal is really working for me. I looked at lose it and did not like it, too many options and pay wall also. 

I am just scared it will make me lose my streak so I just bought a one year prenium for 114$ cad. It is like 10$ a month so I just cancelled crave instead and actually saved 10 $ in subscriptions haha. 

I also use the recipe fonction a loooot and I did not wanna lose all my custom recipes that are already on there.

I think it will also hold me accoundable to use it for one year, which is the expected time of my loss journey. I will probably look into something else for maintenance after that. I think it is worth it if you don't like change like I do ( neurodivergent)."
Yazio cuz its half as popular as mfp so I can easily find products by scanning. Plus it looks pretty & has the carbs protein and fats on the main page
"I was doing Avatar Nutrition for awhile and quite liked it, but no free option. Just started with Cronometer. A lot to like there too, and some things I'd have different. Decided to buy an annual gold membership. If you talk to Eliisa over at r/cronometer she can hook you up with a discount that makes it pretty cost effective"
"I switched to lose it. I wasn’t going to pay for premium, so they made it 1/2 off. $20 for the extra features is worth it to me."
I've used every calorie tracker. Been using lose it for 3 years. It's fantastic. Never found another one that competes. Chronometer is close but has a limited catalog of foods. However it does track every micronutrient which is awesome
I'll carry on with mfp I didn't really use the scanner
I really love My net Diary. I’ve used it for years. I’ve tried a bunch of others but always go back to my net diary.
"I never used MFP (beyond downloading and trying it out) for a lot of reasons, but I'm using cronometer and love it. It does have 5 second adds (skip then) sometimes but it's not too bad. It tracks micronutrients which has helped me figure out what foods to eat to get most of the way there and what vitamin pills I should be taking (which right now is half a multivitamin + a vitamin D pill)."
"I have used Lose it for YEARS. i actually had to download mfp for a project once and felt like it wasn’t as accurate in adding your exercises. I have lose it premium and I think it’s super worth it. It’s very easy to use for a tech dummy like me. I like to track my calories, macros, sodium, cholesterol, water intake, exercise and steps. But they have way more like you can track your sleep and every other nutrient I’m pretty sure as well. There’s a place to put weight and progress pics as well I’m pretty sure. Great app"
I'm using life sum very similar to mfp
"+1 for loseit. Been using it on and off since 2018, love the interface. They had a 60% off promo so I bought lifetime premium"
Yep lose it is the best
"My understanding is that it originally was but a lot of people (myself included) didn’t realize that and so it’s evolved i to a general weight loss sub. I’d been in this sun a while before even realizing there was an app called Lose It. 

And there is a sub called r/loseitapp, just fyi."
Haha I thought the same that this sub is for loseit app
For me a bunch of the loseit numbers were just straight up incorrect. I was eating vastly more than I should have. The calories are more accurate on chronometer so far
I have been following this subreddit for awhile and had never heard of the lose it app until the whole mfp thing. Then I when I heard about it I thought I had a TIL moment but went back and read a bunch of posts.
Also love mynetdiary! I got a good deal and ended up buying premium. Love it.
"I just got my fitbit a week or 2 ago, if you pay you can sync the lose it app to fitbit?"
I used the loseit app like 4 years ago and switched to MFP solely because it was more accurate and had better features. Now that everyone seems to prefer it I think I’m going to switch back and try it out again.
"The functions weren't the same, I tried Lose it for example  and paid for premium and I can't remember everything but I just love how easy it is to copy the meal from today to tomorrow on mfp, and to make recipes and to eat like 1/10th of it etc.

I asked for my money back from Google play store n got it back."
"I use cronometer and don't have this problem.  I think the nutrition information is curated.  You can submit nutrition labels for them to add to the database, but not directly add to the database.  It avoids the problem you're talking about, but means there may be some things with no nutrition at all.   Generally speaking I love cronometer tho"
"This is why I stopped using MFP. Garbage data everywhere. Or the lazy shits only enter the calories but not any of the macros, or only one of the macros. Plus there was not way to flag entries as inaccurate or accurate. Plus weird serving sizes on stuff. I have a food scale. I want to be able to do everything in grams, but nooooo, tablespoons or other odd things.

Use www.cronometer.com. Not as many entries but they are from databases not crowd sourced by lazy people. You can always add your own custom entries easily."
"This is one reason why I use Cronometer instead. They review anything that is accepted into their database, and most data comes from reliable sources (USDA, the restaurants themselves, etc.). That means their database is limited, but drastically more accurate for what is there. If you eat a lot of simple whole foods (like, say, a piece of fruit) the experience of logging it is 10,000x less frustrating on cronometer. I end up entering custom foods a lot more, which is a pain, but worth it for the accuracy (and it's a much faster site). There are downsides but I find myself so much less annoyed than I did with MFP, all because of the crap people spewed into the MFP database."
"Oh man, I was so angry about this last night. Went to log my 180 cal Luna bar on my net diary and I found the exact thing. For 170. Like I know it's only 10 calories difference and I could just log 1.02 servings to make it correct but why are you lying to yourself about those 10 extra calories?! It makes it so annoying for everyone else lol."
This is why I use cronometer. User submissions must be approved before they enter the database.
"i’m sorry, i am a long time lurker to the “lose it” subreddit, so if what i am about to say warrants downvotes then so be it..

but to me, it seems counter intuitive that the general consensus in this post is that of “screw these apps/sites for posting wrong fast food data,” instead of “you shouldn’t be eating fast food to begin with if you’re trying to lose weight.”  

again, maybe i am wrong, or being offensive in saying that.. and if that’s the case, i honestly apologize.

it just seems to me that if the goal is to lose weight, eating healthier should be the goal, right..?  

It’s hard for me to understand putting more blame on an app for misrepresenting calories in a BK combo meal, than yourself for opting to eat at that BK regularly and expecting to lose weight..."

"Seems counterintuitive to be eating at any of those places since you’re trying to lose it... let the app be wrong and eat healthy foods. Then, you won’t have to calorie count!"
"Yes! I used to use the Livestrong calorie tracking app, called MyPlate, and it had verified listings that were accurate and came up first in search. I only switched to MFP because so many r/loseit challenge team members are on it. The only downside to MyPlate was that it didn’t have as many entries for restaurant food and such since it isn’t as popular these days as MFP and LoseIt, but it’s a much better experience. I had used MyPlate on and off starting around 10 years ago up until 1 year ago. 

Edit: the more I talk about MyPlate, the more I want to switch back and say goodbye to those obnoxious MFP ads. "
"I work at Pizza hut and wanted to have a slice of a medium thin pizza and when I searched it on Google a mfp entry came up as 1 calorie. One single calorie. Someone put that in and was like ""yep that looks fine"""
"I have no experience with making bread :( sorry. That said, lose it and mfp are very close. In lose it you can add foods super fast, perhaps that could be a solution."
I noticed the latest loseit update let's you input values by hand without scrolling. Tap the number and it should go into a keyboard.
"As a German living in the UK now, it took me ages to find a good English calorie counter with a good local data base. There is a very good German one (FDDB) with all the local products which is very accurate and even has pictures. After moving, I tried MFP, lifesum, etc... I was especially annoyed with MFP for the reasons you mentioned. 
I then found the NutraCheck calorie counter app. I love it and don’t even mind paying monthly. I find their food entries very accurate and they even have pictures of a lot of the foods and big brands here in the UK."
"As someone who also had an eating disorder I found lifesum pretty toxic tbh. It has very specific ideas for what’s “healthy”, and gives you a sad face if you disagree. "
I’ll check that app out. I’ve used lose it in the past but never was satisfied with it. Thanks.
Do you still get the same amount of topping in the minis and less ice cream or less both ? The prices are so close it feels like the mini is ripping me off.... it costs what normal McFlurrys used to 
"I don’t think I ever said no foods are objectively unhealthy??? But the way that lifesum categories things is not a complete picture and uses a certain algorithm which prioritizes some characteristics over others, not in a way everyone would agree with. "
"I’ve used loseit and my fitness pal. I prefer lose it, it is more dynamic and counts weekly calories which I find helpful"
loseit is pretty good
"Begin with the end in mind, because it answers these questions:

> what meals/food groups in general are best to stick to when in a calorie deficit and intermittent fasting! 

In the end, you'll be wanting to maintain your lost weight eating the foods you enjoy, socializing sometimes, occasional gatherings, holidays/travel, etc..   So temporary things we do are distractions, not helping us to learn to keep off the weight.   Don't eat weirdly to lose weight.  Eat as yourself, and shape your habits up.  Otherwise, we lose and regain in cycles.

> Are there any apps or websites that help calculate calories based on meals you type in, even if you don’t know the breakdown of each ingredient!

The sites MyFitnessPal and Nutritionix (which is a database used by Cronometer and others) have a lot of restaurant data.  The site allrecipies.com is very popular and most of their popular recipes are also entered.   This is helpful for restaurant food, even if it isn't the same restaurant.   

We may not be precise, but we can be generally fair and accurate that way.  If we're making fair guesses, about half will be too high and half too low, *so these errors will nullify each other* and leave us with sums that are very close to true.  This is the **[Law of Large Numbers](https://www.google.com/search?q=law+of+large+numbers)** and it works for us. 

Use the entry from another restaurant and call it good enough.  

Have a personal rule that you don't have to eat all of a meal that you didn't portion.  Restaurant portions are large, and very few restaurant meals are <600 Calories.    Often, we can eat half (for 600) and take half home and get another full meal out of that (for 600) -- 1200 to 1600 for some of these family restaurants is common -- but do itemize it. 

Chains over 20 restaurants in the USA disclose their calories on menus now.  If your Mom & Pop place doesn't, look for an entry for that menu item from a big chain -- it's probably going to be good enough.

Read this for the philosophy of it.  It's fine for Intermittent Fasting.  Usually IF is done without calorie counting but I too have done it with counting.

https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick_start_guide

That's the method to start. Follow that guide and that timing, using your regular and normal food, and using portion control as your main tool for change. In later weeks, use the data to figure out if any foods need to be adjusted. All foods can fit, but sometimes we have to juggle or learn a new way to make an old favorite."
I have been using a free myfitnesspal for years now
"I use my fitness pal. Maybe explain what you dont like avout loose it / MFP since those two seems to be like bbe far the best. Maybe there is something you are using wrong or dont know about

I tried Noom but its so expensive (and i am paying for mfp). They also put my calories reslly high and I could not go lower and the calories they add after work out were really high (i love that my fitness pal barely add cals from working out)"
"I use loseit, got the lifetime in the most recent sale it pushed me for. Gotta occasionally screen foods for sense checks, barcodes are generally pretty accurate in calories. I'm not massively invested in my macros/micros but if I was I might have a different approach, they can be missing or wacky quite often due to the user-maintained submissions"
I use cronometer because it also tracks micronutrients for free
"another pro for MFP, i live in france and ive tried most of the popular android available trackers, every single one other than MFP took less than a day to delete because they have NO database for our food, i can scan pretty much anything in my kitchen rn on mfp and 9 times out of ten itll have the result, normally bang on accurate too, all the other apps just dont have them so you have to create a food for everything"
fatsecret
"Yes but also macros lol. I use cronometer, I love being like 'ooooh I could do with more iron tomorrow' when I'm planning my meals, and going on a wee detective hunt to find something suitable with iron 🤣"
"I used to hate doing it before, but once I started racking up a streak it became more fun.  Also, discovering that I like the mechanics for lose it more versus MFP helped."
"Eating according to calorie density works best for me. Counting calories made me nuts. Plus, I always think how you lose it is how you keep it off and I can't count calories for life."
Why not just use a free calorie tracker like **cronometer**?
"I paid £15.90 for a year - but previously I was using myfitnesspal which was £15.99 a month for less features. 

Tbh I think £15.90 a year for an app I use daily with no issues is a fair price! Definitely wouldn't pay more than that though."
"I ended up just buying the lifetime version. Idk that it’s necessary, but I don’t regret it. Using the loseit app has helped me drop 30 lbs and I’ll keep using it to maintain (at least for awhile) once I drop another 10, so I’m not super bothered by dropping the money on it. But really there’s no reason to unless you want to be able to log tomorrow’s food. I find it helpful, but you definitely don’t need it to succeed!"
"This one is also free, you just have to pay if you want the ""premium"" features. I did see that Cronometer is also mentioned a lot here; it was almost a tie between recommendations for cronometer and lose it. Then I read a couple review blogs that tipped the favor to 'lose it'. I'm really enjoying the app so far!"
I use my net diary app to scan barcodes and just guess the best I can. It's been working well so far and takes the stress out. You can build recipes and save favorite foods. Nothing has to be perfect if it works and you are allowed to change things until you find something that works that you don't hate.
"This has been a lifesaver!  I use it on the PC as it's even easier, which makes me sad that the loseit app is no longer supporting the web version."
"Chronometer is good.  
But, honestly, I think paying for loseit is worth it. I get if you don't want to buy it, that's totally reasonable — but I caved and bought it, and haven't looked back since. Plus, it's on sale right now, and is constantly going on sale for more than 50% off."
"I like chronometer (free). I tracked using lose it, my fitnesspal, and chronometer at the same time for a few days and decided which one i liked most and what was easiest for me to use. Maybe try all of them for a few."
"If you're based in Ireland or UK I would say myfitnesspal, as the barcode scanner still works!"
If you have an Apple Watch you can manually put In calories through the app on the Apple Watch on lose it.
"im using loseit and its been great so far, plus you can make your own recipes"
"I just wanted to share with you a comment I left on another post

loseit :)
Also I like the lose it app
"[This is what I did.](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/s/zYgBQnhWAp) I eat some of my calories back. I’m a small person. I usually eat 1,500-1,700 cal a day but exercise and burn 500 cal daily, sometimes more because I’m currently doing 75 hard."
"I'm not sure what options myfitnesspal has, but I use cronometer.  I make sure I know the estimated calories before I choose to eat it.  Then I search by ingredient and it usually has an option for cups or tablespoons.  That is easy for me to estimate since I cook a lot, so I use that.  I have a half cup sitting on my counter to help sometimes.  So, I break down most of my meals.  Hamburger = bun, beef patty, tomato, lettuce, mayo, mustard, pickles.  I list them all out individually."
"I use Cronometer to build recipes :) I’ve used my fitness pal and lose it, but prefer Cronometer"
"I had 100 to lose, so I made a 52 week commitment to log.  I couldn't commit to ""forever.""  I still can't.

"I’m a dad (26M) of 2 that works full-time and also has ADHD. I weighed 340+ at my heaviest and without counting calories i managed I get down to 295 in a year or so but it was mostly attributed to taking on a much more physically active job than anything. I was stuck in the 290s until my doctor told me to download mynetdiary and buy a food scale. 

It was a long 18 months of trial and error but I’m down to 240 and losing around 10 pounds a month now. From my experience it’s possible to lose weight without tracking calories but if you want to lose the weight and keep it off, Relearning how to eat and have a healthy relationship though tracking calories is the most important thing you can do. 

My tips to you are learn to plan and adjust your food intake through out the day. if you going to have a big dinner then have a light breakfast or lunch to make up for it.  There are many different ingredients you can substitute for lower calorie options and calorie tracking apps can help you understand if the ingredient your looking to swap in a recipe will make a big enough difference or not to justify it."
"> But I feel a bit disheartened and like I’ve wasted my hard work in the past 3 weeks because I have eaten 1700 cals (including those from exercise) - should I feel this way? 

Feelings aren't right or wrong, they're just feelings.  I try not to form opinions about mine, let alone others' feelings.

We suggest that the first week be just logging your regular food (not trying to lose weight).  In week 2, choose a target and eat with the target in mind.

Personally, it takes me 3 weeks to start hitting my targets reliably.  My inner child loves his food but eventually goes along with the program.  

Our philosophy and guide:  https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick_start_guide

That's the method to start. Follow that guide and that timing, using your regular and normal food, and using portion control as your main tool for change. In later weeks, use the data to figure out if any foods need to be adjusted. All foods can fit, but sometimes we have to juggle or learn a new way to make an old favorite."
"I have had a bad week at work and indulged hard at Arby's a couple times. First time I wasn't going to add it to my mfp, but I did. For the same reasons. This is a life change I'm trying to accomplish and I cannot make progress when lying.

Also it's a motivator when seeing how many calories were eaten and the true cost of the mistake. "
I like lose it for this - you can create recipes to either use multiple times if it’s exactly the same or just edit the quantities in an already created recipe. I find it really intuitive to use!
Thanks! I'm trying cronometer right now as the other comment suggested. I'll try lose it if I end up not liking it.

> How do I accurately calculate the calories without needing a scale? 

By buying the scale.  It was the best money I've spent in this effort.  Even though you can't carry it everywhere, use it when you can at home and it'll help calibrate your eyes and hands.  

Week 1 has some further ideas to supplement when you don't have a kitchen scale or measuring cups with you, but buy those and use them when you can.

>  I am using the MyfitnessPal app and I wanted to ask whether it is accurate or not?

It's crowdsourced and some entries are nonsense.   Try to find entries from USDA or institutions and be wary of those that seem too good to be true.   Look for those green-checked entries that suggest that they are more reliable than other entries.

>  I wanted to ask whether it is accurate or not? If I am making something in olive oil, do I need to input the oil separately or is it included in the dish mentioned?

For complete dishes where oil is part of the traditional recipe, you can consider it as already counted.    Where the oil is used for cooking and is absorbed up into the food you're cooking, you need to add the oil that you used.       If some oil is left behind in the pan, you can deduct that uneaten amount from the amount you're adding into your log.

Nobody 70+ kg maintains fat on 1200, you're burning something.   Did you start weightlifting?  Are you miscounting because you don't have a scale to check your portions?"
"Switch to cronometer, it has grams for every item."
"I measure my ingredients dry or uncooked, in grams. I use myfitnesspal though. 

For meat, the weight is usually listed on the package. If it wasn’t, I would put a bowl or plate on the scale, zero it, and then add the raw meat.

So if I was making rice and meat to last me a few days:

Measure out 200 grams of uncooked rice (~750 calories). If you’re using microwaveable packets, you can just use whatever the package says. You don’t need to weigh. 

Measure out half a pound of raw meat (250 calories for half a pound raw chicken breast) 

Add rice and chicken calories (~1000 calories)

Divide by number of meals I’m splitting them up into (so if I’m eating half today, that’s 500 calories). Leaving 500 for tomorrow."
"I get the wanting to do everything correctly and exactly and while it is important to differ between cooked or uncooked rice/pasta /quinoa or other things that absorb a lot of water when cooking it's not an exact science what your specific package of rice contains as long as its not seasoned or has extra ingredients except for brown rice. Look up calories per gram for cooked brown rice on your app, here is how my app (lifesum) logs cooked and uncooked brown rice :[brown rice](https://imgur.com/a/HRu3dkq)

Then cook your food, put your plate on the scale, reset the scale and then add as many grams of cooked rice you are planning to eat. 

This will be accurate enough."
"A cup is a standard for measurement of volume. Buy a measuring cup that says cup, and that is “1 cup.” 1 cup is how much stuff will fit in that cup. This is kind of inaccurate as you can imagine as 1 cup of rice will be more food than 1 cup of, say, broccoli florets. So measuring by weight proper via grams is definitely better, especially as exact amounts in a pouch or container could vary. Most labels should include a per gram on the label. For example, My packets say 1 pouch (250 grams) is 450 cals. So, I can measure my rice post-pouch and get, say 260 grams, maybe my pouch was a little extra filled at the factory. I know that 450/250 = 1.8 calorie per gram. So i ended up with 1.8*260 = 468 calories. Four meals is now 468/4 = 117 cals per meal.

If your rice cooks cooks in 2 mins in the microwave, I can guarantee that it is not as “uncooked” as dry rice actually is, my reasoning for the pouch holds. 

For a composed dish like pasta, the loseit app will have a recipe feature. Put in all ingredients; 2 tbsp oil, 1 can tomatoes, 1 lb beef, x amount pasta.
There are two ways you can go about determining calorie per amount eaten.
Easiest way is to eyeball it. If you are getting three even meals out of that, set the “total recipe size” to 3 servings and now you can log 1 serving of that recipe when you eat your meal. I recommend doing this, as it is super easy, and if you are eating all of it yourself or even splitting even amounts with someone else the difference doesn’t really matter as long as your plates look about the same.

Alternatively, you could weigh the cooked meal in grams (THIS IS FOR SERVING SIZE PURPOSES. Ingredients should stay as they are. You aren’t going to pick ground beef out if pasta and weigh that. Leave the raw meat weight in the recipe itself). Say my meal is 300 grams. You can set the “total recipe size” as 300 servings. If my bowl of pasta is 135 grams, i can log that as 135 servings.

In both cases, the important thing is to just make sure things look split up evenly. If your partner has 6 meatballs and you only have 1, you wouldn’t be accurate if you both logged “1 serving.” Just make sure things look approximately evenly distributed and cal it a day. If you are the only one eating your meals, it matters less. You are getting all the calories in from that recipe eventually, its okay if technixally on day 1 you ate slightly less of it than you do on day 2.

For actual cooked vs uncooked rice, the label should specify. My rice specifies 170 calories per 46g dry rice. If I’m eating two meals from that I just log 23 grams per meal aka 85 calories. If youre going to be splitting meals unevenly, then weigh cooked rice. Say my 46g dry became 100g cooked. That is still 170 calories of rice. So now, 170 cal / 100 gram cooked rice = 1.7 cals per gram. So if my bowl of cooked rice I pile in is like, 62 grams, that is 62 g * 1.7 cal/g = 105.4 cals. If loseit has this rice as “mil,” just input whatever mil amount makes 105.4 cals. If this kind of math is confusing, I highly recommend using the loseit custom food feature so you can input the food with measurements you use, vs having to use whatever exists in loseit entries already made."
How am I supposed to do it on loseit. It does not have the grams option for rice. mL is there as well as cups. But I have no idea what a cup is or how many gs or how to put it down on loseit. and that's for the minute rice how am i supposed to do it with other rices
I am not understanding at all. How does it make it to one cup? What even is one cup? How many g is in a cup? Every where I look its just one cup is one cup. How am I supposed to divide that into my meals into lose it
"I think I'm in the minority, but I really dislike them all. I find it a huge chore. I get how helpful it is, especially since my calorie goal is so low, but I can never do it for more than a day or 2 at a time. That being said, I am trying to log food more consistently. 

When I'm eating things that are already in mfp I don't mind it as much, like if I can scan a granola bar etc. what I really hate I hate when I meal prep  or make food at home and have to add and weigh every ingredient I used or try to find a recipe very similar. Again, I get it, i see how it's useful, I really do, but it just feels so tedious and time consuming.

I also hate how low it automatically sets certain goals like sugar. I have a problem with sugar, I admit that. But having any little item put me over my sugar goal was very disheartening. I keep eating less per day but I would have liked a way to set it at a goal that worked for me at the time and adjust it to what it should ideally be over a period of time. Like if I was drinking the equivalent of 4 sodas a day, set my personal goal at like 2 rather than automatically at like .5 a can.  I have gotten significantly better but that bothered me a lot at first. I felt like no matter how little sugar I ate I couldn't eat as little as it wanted me to. (That may be a paid setting, but even if it is I'm not paying $50 for it)

"
"When I just started out, I just wanted to count my calories to see where I was at. I didn't want to set a goal or aim for anything. Yet MFP and every other app I could find required this of you. It would be great if that was a feature to turn on or off. The red numbers and texts might be motivating for some but not to me at all. I would like to have the choice to turn them off entirely or just make the text black like everywhere else on the app.

I am down to having to eat 1370 kcals a day to lose 1 lb a week and it's hard. Yesterday I ate 1385 and was pretty happy, but that red -15 is so annoying!

It would be nice to be able to report wrong entries. 

Automatic conversion between metric and imperial. Sometimes thr best entries are in imperial units instead of metric. If something os typed with a serving of 4 fl. oz I would like to be able to input 2 dl and have it output the correct amount.

Same goes for serving sizes of the same unit. A Daim bar is 28 g per serving in mfp - if I choose to eat 35 g I need to bring up a calculator or get better at doing math in my head. It would be neat to be able to just type 35 g instead of 1,25 serving."

"Yeah that's fine, just different opinions just wanted to note mine so OP had all perspectives. I don't make friends on the app I just add people from loseit, helps me stay motivated. I agree the diary should be default page, that's typically what I log in for 90% of the time!"
"I went on a logging streak for 411 days... basically my entire weight loss phase, plus a couple of months of maintenance. I made a commitment to myself to log everything I ate every day for 1 year, no matter if I was on track for the day or eating my feelings in pizza and chips (though that rarely happened). I manually changed my calories throughout that time, sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing. I didn't add in exercise calories. The calorie goal that I set was what I stuck to. 

Eventually (especially during weight loss), you'll reach a point when 95% of the food you eat is already saved into the app. I use the loseit app, so pretty much every meal that I've eaten in the last year is already saved. So when I need to track its as easy as typing ""jasmine rice"" into the meal search bar, and then it will automatically pull up the 5oz of chicken breast, 100g of jasmine rice, 85g of sweet peas and .5 tbls olive oil that I was going to log since I keep my portions pretty much the same.. and if I planned to eat more rice, I could easily just make that adjustment. The same happens when I type in  ""Chipotle"" and it pulls up my standard burrito and chips and gauc. Now it takes me 5-10 minutes a day to log my food. It would probably be less than 5, but I spend several minutes trying to figure out how to meet my protein goal for the day.."
"I tracked for around 500 days at my longest streak and only stopped when I got pregnant and decided to take a break from it. Once I have the baby I’ll get back to it. 

I just made it a habit. Using lose it, it was pretty easy to type something I’d eaten before and it would pull it up. I measured most things on a food scale and guessed for restaurants. There were also plenty of days that I just tracked something general. For example on my birthday and big holidays I may track a generic bbq meal or thanksgiving meal and call it a day. As long as I am accurate 80% of the time, I continued to meet my goals."
"I'm at 66 days since switching to loseit. The right app works. The app has to be motivational in some way. I dislike mfp but keep going back to it when I have a fitbit. I used Noom for a year and the app is motivating enough to use for 12 months for me in 2020. This Nov. I started the loseit app and the data is displayed in ways I like, it has functions I need, and it shows you a streak count for closing out the day. It also lets you close out a missed day if you forgot to complete it. It also has an option to upload a picture of a meal, which is good for eating out with friends you can take a good pic and upload it or wait til later, and guestimate the calories better visually. It also lets you future plan meals for the week so they are easier to enter the day of."
I like lose it
"I installed lose it and it was like $39.99 for a year subscription if you wanted the added features. I declined and it immediately offered me 50% off, so it was $19.99 for a full year."
"It does look like they are double counting as you’ve described, so it would be overestimating your discounts. Personally, I would just adjust your activity level to the one that best matches, and not use the calorie discount part. Those “activity calories” are generally not very reliable, and can make it easy to overestimate how many calories you need. There’s way to still have those workouts and steps log in lose it but not actually count towards daily calories. 

End of the day, youre losing weight, and that’s all that really matters, so do whatever makes it easier. Good luck!"
"A calorie deficit is required to lose weight. Calorie counting is the most direct way to get there, but its not the only way.

If you do decide to retry it take a look at the [quick start guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick_start_guide), and start by counting without restricting. That can take a lot of pressure off while you learn about what you're currently eating."
"I still count calories even five years into maintenance.  I understand how you feel. My life doesn't necessarily feel like a ""diet"", but both losing weight and maintaining my weight loss does take pretty well constant attention to diet. There was a post on here a couple years back that really stuck with me on this topic: [Monica Geller and her inner fat girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/5x6orj/monica_geller_and_her_inner_fat_girl/)

>I was watching Friends last night. Season 4, episode 2. Monica gets a date with the 'popular' guy of their high school days and Rachel isn't happy about it because the guy (Chip Matthews) cheated on her at their senior prom. Monica tries to explain why she wants to go on the date:  
Monica: Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I...I owe her this. I never let her eat!  
And that really spoke to me. Right now, I'm still a fat girl. I am in the midst of making a lifestyle change and at the end, I will reap the rewards of being at a healthy, lower weight. However, there will ALWAYS be a fat girl inside of me. A little fat girl who preaches overindulgence and instant gratification. I stopped at McDonald's on my way to work this morning to grab my usual coffee. My inner fat girl gleefully pointed out a delicious-looking blueberry cheese danish in the glass cabinet on the counter. I hesitated and started doing some quick mental math about how I could eat less later. There were little placards sitting neatly in front of each type of pastry. 330 calories read the one for the danishes. That was enough to snap me out of it. I wasn't even hungry!!! I had a good lunch in my bag that included a yummy 120 calorie tapioca pudding for my afternoon snack!  
I said no to my inner fat girl. And I'll be denying her many times (not all!!!) for the rest of my life.

This is me. I'm always going to have to remain vigilant to avoid regaining the weight. Some people don't. Is that fair? No, but that's life. It does suck sometimes."
You gotta download myfitnesspal
"Just put in a different weight. Any calculations it would give you would be wrong anyway, since you aren't what they would count as sedentary. And seconding the vote for cronometer as a free app."
"Yeah, but you still end up having to use loseit, you'd be better off without that."
"The free version of cronometer has a recipe function, so you could weigh the ingredients as you make something, then weigh the total mass of the finished product and then weigh out your portion.

Or some people will find a similar online recipe that has a calorie count and use that."
"I just look in myfitnesspal for something similar from a restaurant or grocery store deli, etc. It’s not perfectly accurate but so long as the size/amount is close I figure it’s good enough for my purposes."
"OMG I'm still fighting baby weight and agreed to be in a wedding in 12 weeks. I feel your pain! Good luck!!

Also, there are a bunch if really useful apps for this. I use myfitnesspal and if you eat similar things pretty regularly, you only have to do the math the first time. After that its in a ""recent"" column. Makes it much easier."
I tend to use mine and weight the individual amounts of each thing and then add it all together rather than using mfp. :)
I look forward to it now. I enjoy putting everything in myfitnesspal and planning what I’ll eat.
"I put a can of tomatoes in don’t you worry. I think you’re missing the point of what this comment was going for. I haven’t put the full recipe in because I was trying to explain a point. I’m not going for a cookbook based off a loseit thread, I’m trying to explain a concept to op…."
"Google similar dishes from restaurants that have calories listed. 

Lookup in loseit for similar dishes

Try to estimate based on the components / ingredients you can see in the meal

Log something that sounds about right, assume more oil on restaurant food than home cooked. 

Enjoy your day :) life includes celebrations and holidays, it's what you do the rest of the year that counts."
Found an app called my net diary. Very helpful
"If you can afford $20, join lose it for a 7 day trial, cancel it, & youll get a coupon for $20 for a year

you can scan barcodes & its community entries

I personally got the cheapest scale on amazon, lose it app, and meal prepping with aldi’s + publixes foods
and veggies from walmart"
"I used to calorie count using myfitnesspal and it would never last. I think I obsess over the numbers A LOT, especially being able to see exact numbers. So on days where I’d go over I’d feel like crap and on days I’m under I’d constantly find whatever food I can eat to fill the 1200/1300 calories and those usually end up being really poor snacking decisions. It definitely became all that I thought about all day and I’d go onto the app just to log what I think I’d eat the next day and when I fail to fulfill that exactly, I felt even crappier.

I’ve just started my journey again early November and I still look at calories online or on the food packaging, but I do a mental calculation instead of on a app. Sometimes I might use a calculator because math is hard haha, but I’ve found I don’t binge or feel like crap just by seeing rough numbers instead of exact figures. Also this reinforces how many calories are in the food I eat in my memory because I’m taking so much mental notes, instead of just scanning a food item using an app, so these days I’m able to guesstimate better and obsess less and less with numbers while still losing weight."
"I use calorie counter by fat secret.  Can track calories, macros, your weight, there’s a diary option if you want etc."
"I'll admit I don't know the current state, but last time I used loseit! All the needed basics were free. Weight tracking, food tracking, barcode scanning, ect. Plus nice grafts. I've had a lifetime sub for years now, and I got that on sale for really cheap, so if you catch it on sale (which it often is) it's totally worth it in my opinion."
I tried mfp and lose it! Stuck with lose it because the interface is simple and not a lot of clutter. Ended up buying the lifetime plan because I enjoy using it so much. I do think they got rid of the scanner on the free side but either way it’s got a massive library of food.
I’ve tried loseit and Cronometer and preferred Cronometer but they’re both free so see what you like!
MacroFactor - [https://macrofactorapp.com/](https://macrofactorapp.com/)
"I like myfitnesspal but I would suggest subscribing if you could because it’s really in depth with macros. There’s also a steps feature. What I really love most about the app is the scan barcode feature, you can scan any food item and it’s automatically added towards your daily intake (you can also adjust serving size so if you’re doing 1/2, it lets you record 1/2 the serving!"
"I use myfitnesspal, it is easy to use, can make recipes on there so next time you make the dish it will all be on there ready. Not sure if you can share with family as I just do it on my own."
"cronometer.  dumb name, awesome app."
"I'd love to know why you prefer cronometer! I've been using MFP and I like that it lays out meal by meal (that you can customize), that it shows calories as you search (crono just shows the database they're pulling from, you have to click it to see calories and see if it's the same one you're looking for), and I like that MFP has forums. So far, the only thing better about cronometer is the nice graphs. Though MFP has those, too. I feel like I must be missing something lol"
"I use cups and tablespoons as a measuring unit as much as possible on my loseit app.  For meats I use the rule of 1 thumb equals an ounce, palm equals 4 ounces, and a fist equals 6 ounces.  Not perfect but it has worked well for me. Good luck."
"I work FT, have a wife, kid, normal life and just count the calories. I use lose it. I eat fresh meals most of the time. I eat out sometimes. I’ve been on two vacations this summer and counted. I’m not entirely sure what is complicated about calorie counting. I just do it because the alternative is being fat and I don’t want to be fat. 

Maybe you could explain what the tough spot is for you and I could tell you how I manage that particular thing?"
I think EVERY app lets you just enter calories.  At least mfp and loseit for sure
"So go into lose it, turn off all meals except snacks. Rename snacks to calories. Add a food called 1000 calories. Add it in any time you have the calories and use it as a decimal. If you have 238 calories pick your food called 1000 calories and put it in as .239 servings. Easy oeasy"
"Wow what an amazing achievement! Thanks for sharing. I also love lose it and have been using it off and on for a long time. 

What is your physical activity like? Are you male? Do you ever completely miss days for calorie counting?"
"Thanks for taking the time to post. I’m losing with lose it right now, I do find it the most reliable way to track and I also identify with understanding this is a lifetime thing after 30 years of yo yo dieting. My question is- do you add your workouts/walks into the app and let it give you more calories to eat or do you exclude the totals from your tracking?"
How do you feeling about lose it making the barcode scanner a premium feature?
"I’ve never seriously looked at another app, so I can’t compare lose it to anything else. I’m sorry."
Lifesum is a good app. It's like myfitnesspal but I like the user interface better in lifesum and it feels lighter. I do pay for premium but it's not necessary to count calories and use the app in general
"I liked Noom when I first started. I knew the information they were telling me, but I actually quite liked their articles, felt a bit more normal than just ‘diet by eating 1200 calories’. It kept me on track while forming the habits. I didn’t mind counting as much because it helped lead me and didn’t quite feel like counting haha. Eventually I didn’t want to pay and switched to lose it, but I kept the habits of counting calories and weighing every day. Yeah their red foods are dumb, but it also helped me realize how many calories were in peanuts for example. I used to think peanuts I could just eat forever 😅"
Thanks for the macrofactor tip. I have been using it for a week now and LOVE it!
"[https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/search/?q=without%20counting%20calories](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/search/?q=without%20counting%20calories)

lots of good threads"
"So, I use lose it, but I'm trying to find something that gives me a goal window instead of a calorie number so I can get in the window if that makes sense?"
"Does it let you set a calorie goal window instead of a specific number? I'm using lose it now, and I think i'll be more successful with the mental game if I can have a range that's my goal instead of a specific number. Am I making any sense?"
Omg thank you! I use cronometer and it’s been reaaaaally annoying me that I have to adjust my bmr every few days because otherwise it keeps redoing the activity calculation based on my new weight and the total calories burned keeps changing. I didn’t realise I had it on sedentary activity level and I could just set it to none!
"For me I found that not tracking exacerbated undereating. Using cronometer (my favorite site) and watching all the little nutrition bars turn green helped me focus on food as a nutritious friend. 

I never had a real ED though, just some mild tendencies that could have turned bad if I hadn't nipped them early on. It might be different if it had gotten bad. 

FWIW I don't necessarily advocate long-term calorie counting, but what I do advocate is finding the method that works for you and keeping an eye on your mental health. "
"That is how I gained and lost the same twenty pounds over and over and over. I couldn't do it sustainably without either getting the fuck-its and gaining more, or turning to calorie counting to lose it. So I'm a calorie counter now."
"Yeah, it's a very inexact science to estimate people's calories algorithmically - a 6' 220lb male like me can range anywhere from 2000-3500 TDEE, and loseit has no way of telling. It's only a starting point anyway - take whatever sounds good to you and adjust after a couple weeks, rinse and repeat."
"I also work nights and just count my calories by 24 hour days. I changed the meal names in mfp to better reflect things (at least imo). So maybe you could just change it to list dinner 1st for the date, then breakfast, lunch, whatever other meals you normally eat. 

The way I've always seen it is that if I'm eating 600 calories at 2am, and then 600 more at 4pm or whenever it may be, I still get to 1200 for the day. And then after midnight the next day starts."
"It's pretty subjective. Try a few of them and see which ones might suit your purposes.. I like lose it because it has a large database of foods, custom recipes and the full version is cheaper than any of the other ones."
I’ve had good experiences with myfitnesspal. I like that it allows you to make recipes and stuff. I’m sure many of them let you do that.
"The Daily Q&A thread is the place for things you know are common questions.

Our Quick Start Guide has a list.  Most are free for the basics/essentials with a fee for additional features.

https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick_start_guide"
"i use the lose it! app.  it gets data from iphone's 'health' and 'fitness' apps, plus data from my wyze digital scale.  i have created in-app recipes for homemade stuff like tuna salad, beef stew, etc so i can get the real nutrition info, plus the app has info for a gazillion ingredients and restaurant foods.

there are more good features, but i already sound like an advertiser.

i track calories, exercise, fasting times, macro nutrients.

F67 / sw 214.8 / cw 174.5 / gw 150"
"I like FatSecret. Terrible name but for macro breakdown, I thought it was better than mfp because I am mainly tracking protein and carb intake"
"I use Macros first- been using it for two years and it’s the only one I’ve stuck with. I tried zero, lose it, mfp… for some reason it just clicks with me"
"I use the free version of MyNetDiary on iPhone. The barcode scanner is great and it doesn’t pester you with subscription popups, and the UI is generally great. 

Didn’t like myfitnesspal’s barcode scanner and food library as much, but this could be a country thing."
"I love my net diary, it has recently added intermittent fasting."
Ive downloaded lose it but macros are hidden ?
"in my experience, 16:8 by itself only helped me maintain my weight.  I had to do more to lose it and CICO definitely helped with that.  Just the act of counting makes you reassess your diet entirely.  You'll look at soda a different way."
"I use cronometer for all my food tracking, and i have premium so it comes with IF tracking too."
I have been using myfitnesspal but I don't like it anymore :/. I'll check loseit !
"Yep! Build a recipe and then input how much a serving is (eg. A cup, 100g, etc.). I used to go this on MFP and now do it on cronometer. Super handy feature on both."
myfitnesspal
I use lose it!
cronometer super accurate too
"WAY depends on your stats and exercise level. Try an online calculator, or weight loss app (I use loseit)."
myfitnesspal
"It's not the best tool for everyone, but counting calories definitely works for weight loss, and /r/loseit has the proof of CICO working.  I wouldn't hesitate to send someone there for help and insight.

Personally, I don't count, but my habits didn't need it.  As I see it, all else being equal, a calorie is a calorie.  IF just makes it easier for those of us who don't count calories."
Had only try loseit and zero. Among the two I prefer Zero but i use it only counting down my fast with nice visuals.
I switched from fitness pal to cronometer and love cronometer.
"I recently transitioned to using both IF and calorie counting and I’ve seen really nice results. I’ve lost 5 pounds in my first two weeks. I expect this to slow down significantly as 2.5 pounds/week isn’t sustainable for me long term, but it’s nice to see the scale move. 

My fasting window varies depending on my hunger level but having an eating window has made calorie counting much easier for me. 

I have used myfitnesspal in the past and recently transitioned to using lose it, which I really like and highly recommend. I haven’t used fat secret."
"Using a calorie counting app helped me realize how much I was over eating and what healthy portions look like. My husband and I love to cook so the app we use, loseit, allows us to put in our own recipes and get a better idea of the calories for our meal choices. Even if you are eating ""healthy foods"" they might still pack a big calorie punch and an app might help identify that. If you do decide to use an app, stick with it for at least a month so you get into the habit of it. 

During my IF journey the scale has been both my best friend and the kid on the playground taunting me. It was great early on when my weight loss was pretty consistent. Every time I would step on the scale it felt like I was accomplishing something. Now a year and a half in, the weight loss has slowed down and so it does not feel as useful on a daily basis. So my advice is to use the scale but not be tied to it. Pictures for me are the real motivator, because the scale is not the whole story. 

Best of luck!"
Second lose it. Although you can also use it for IF tracking too but it isn't as thorough as zero but still fits my needs
"Make sure it’s a kitchen scale. Using cronometer or a similar website/app, you can input the food and the weight and it will tell you calories. Give it a try and come back with any questions."
"Congratulations, and that's what loans (Care Credit?) are for, lol! 

Erika Lugo (she was a biggest loser trainer who had also lost a lot of weight) got skin removal surgery and it seems like such a good positive experience for her! 

Search other subreddits too   
r/BariatricSurgery or r/loseit"
I used myfitnesspal
"I have a mix of MyFitnessPal premium, and trying out Cronometer - https://cronometer.com/"
"[Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) is pretty awesome.
Scan the barcode on the food label or enter in staples like meat, vegetables and dairy etc.

Log *everything* that goes into your mouth.  Calories are sneaky little bastards and will add up much faster than you think."
I like lose it
"Yeah, if I'm starving myself nonstop. Otherwise, no.

I don't understand why people are afraid of calories. It gives me peace of mind. I love counting calories. It takes me 10 seconds to log my calories after every meal. I open my phone, spreadsheet, log my calories, close it.  I've memorized every food that I like to eat at this point. I don't even think about it. I'm like a robot.

Fuck everything else. Too much anxiety. Will I lose weight this month or cry in my pillow at night wondering where I went wrong? blah blah blah. With counting, I know I'm going to lose weight, and how much approximately. It's an amazing feeling. Why do anything else? So much time lost if you fuck up 'eyeballing' things. Why risk it?"
'lose it!' is the app i use.  i count calories as well as follow IF.
macrofactor is the best app you can possibly download. no questions
I use myfitnesspal for tracking calories and Zero for the fasting window.
I use both of these and lose it for counting calories 🤣
"Life, Zero. Both good apps, I’ve used them both, right now I use Zero. And I also have the fat secret app on my phone for food tracking ."
I’m using cronometer. I started 16:8 last month and moved to whole food plant based 2 weeks ago. It has been a savior giving me calories as well as daily RDI targets and macros. The good part is that I can take the info I need and ignore the rest. And it’s free.
">So, if that happens, being exact with the calories daily doesn't matter because all the calories are going to be going towards my weekly TDEE total. In the end, it's about hitting your weekly total defict goal rather than your daily goal.

Really? I was going with a use your daily calorie allowance or lose it approach..."
"Kimchi stew and thai stir fry are both available in myfitnesspal so you can count calories. It doesn't need to be perfect, but you really do need to do some counting of calories.

Even being in the ballpark will help.

There's no getting around the fact that if you're gaining, you're almost certainly eating enough to be in a calorie surplus.

Keep a food log or use an app to count calories for a week or two. That should be enough to at least get a better idea of how many calories you're actually consuming in an ordinary  week."
" Another vote for myfitnesspal app, I've used it, and you can create your own recipes/meals so you don't have to enter all the ingredients every time. Other apps, too, that's just the one I've used. The QR scanner is wonderful! If you don't already have a food scale, I would recommend getting one. I learned a lot about portion size! Also, someone else said recipes already in the app are close enough, and I couldn't agree more. For some of us,  me included, that can be challenging but better to track ""pretty close"" than get frustrated and not track at all.  Speaking from experience, that mentality can help find balance with other commitments on those days when ""life happens"". Good luck!"
"Do a free trial of that app and see what numbers it gives you. I put in my heigh, current weight and what my activity levels are and then set my goal weight and how fast I wanted to lose it. That’s how I came up with the numbers"
"I use the lose it app, you can purchase premium and get extras but you can use it without too."
I like lose it.
"cronometer for calories/nutrients

life for fasting because I don't like cronometers fasting stuff"
"So many. I find the layout of the Fitbit one the best, Samsung health is cool too if you have a Samsung. Eat this much is interesting for recipes in a calorie controlled way. If you have an iPhone I think theres an app called peach that is good. Also if your not too calorie controlled myfitnesspal is always the one people talk about most.

But you dont have to pay for any of these and I'm not really sure how good the ones you have to pay for are since I am a cheap b*tch."
"Fitbit Integration.

If you put in a weight tracker, you might as well also put in a meal/macro tracker. If you could have the functionality of cronometer, with the socal aspect of MFP, that would be absolutely baller."
"I've been using lifesum now for 3 months. Its hands down my favorite free app, and you can scan bar codes. "
"surprised no one has mentioned fatsecret. terrible name, but I’ve been using it for 4 years and its free with the occasional ad. has a barcode scanner too"
what do you like about it? currently using free version of mfp 😊
"\+1 to macrofactor! I used to use LoseIt and macro factor is like better LoseIt.  if you log your food and weight for long enough, it gives you an accurate estimate of your TDEE"
"Yup. I used loseit during my first weight loss journey too. It had me at 1500 calories and I dropped weight like a rock, nearly 10lbs a month, I was miserable but hey, I’m short and that’s what every TDEE calculator told me I needed to lose weight. 

Macro has me at 2800 maintenance and 2000 1.5lbs a week loss which is more than good enough for me."
I use loseit and paid for the barcode scanner.
"Is it my net diary? Icon is a green apple?

I use this one and I am really happy with it. I bought the premium version back in 2012 so I don’t know how this changes the experience, but unlike my fitness pal, the best features aren’t hidden behind an expensive subscription"
"I use macrofactor, its awesome afff"
Try cronometer
Yep it’s mynetdiary!
"I use lose it app and I input in grams. I create a recipe, add all the ingredients in which some were scanned and there it is with correct info and some I search and may be good or I need to update, and very few manually input. In Germany so not all food are in the database. 

Then after cooking I weigh and put in how much it weighs. When I eat, I weigh how much on my plate and input that in. 

The next time I make this recipe, I can update the ingredients and weight and it will not change the past input. So if past Tuesday I used 100 grams avocado and this week 126 grams, the last week input in the log itself will not change."
"Yes, I find lose it to be the easiest to use with my scale. Sometimes people only have the “serving” and I have a hard time trusting it but you can usually find another option on the app that allows for grams or ounces."
I use cronometer
"cronometer is best - barcode scan, micronutrient focus"
I’m not sure what everyone else uses but I lose it ap. It’s easy to navigate and I find the free version has everything I need. Happy counting :)
cronometer
I can recommend lifesum
"I've tried both MyFitnessPal and LoseIt. I prefer MFP because it has a larger database to search for food in. I've also found a lot of MFP friends both from this sub and the r/loseit sub so I enjoy the community aspect of it. I do hate the ads and the clunky interface, but it's worth it IMO for everything else."
I second lose it
"It probably has varied accuracy depending on where in the world you are. If you're somewhere very populated a lot of ppl are gonna scan a lot of products and a lot more are gonna correct any mistakes. Regarding meat yeah, cronometer has a bunch of data from USDA and NCCDB that I frankly trust more than manufacturers labels where I live."
"I reinstalled lifesum again, gonna give it a couple days try, just to see"
"For calorie counting, I’ve used MyFitnessPal and loseit. 

I prefer loseit but both were ok. 

As far as recording workouts … can you elaborate on what you mean by that?

For myself, I have a Fitbit, so I use that with loseit to track my exercise. 

I’ve started using Hevy for weightlifting too but I’m only starting to figure it out"
"loseit is my favourite! i’ve only tried lose it or lifesum, but definitely loseit is better"
i like lose it. i feel like it’s pretty accurate with calories and they have a lot of work out options(if you wanna see how much you’ve burned)
"Myfitnesspal! I just use the free version because I has every feature that I need. I tried a few other apps but none of them had a huge database like mfp. The only downside is you need to double check that the entry you’re selecting actually matches the nutrition label on your food. If you just want to rely on the app and never read the actual labels, I’ve heard Cronometer is good for this. The database is smaller but the entries are typically accurate."
"I used the Fitbit one for six months and then gave up and went back to my fitness pal. I'm not sure if you need to pay for it, but the sync between Fitbit and mfp is awesome."
lose it ‼️
"I also live in Japan. They are extremely good about having exact calories on all of their store bought food, however they often base their calories off of 100g or 100ml over the amount actually in the container so pay attention to that. I often scan things with myfitnesspal and have to manually create the food, but its worth your time to do so with foods you often eat. 

There are somethings here that you cant get a hold of such as egg whites, and other common health foods in other countries, but they do have a lot of veggies, meat, and especially fish that are awesome and often way cheaper than America. 

Japan is not a magical place and you can easily gain wait here if you over eat despite the people around you being so skinny. I often have to remind myself that Japanese people dont eat all the sweets and delicious (like the breads!) things available here every day they only eat them every once in a while. Make the fried foods like karage and kushikatsu a treat only, but things like sushi, yakitori, and okonomiyaki are good foods to get while eating out.

Some of the lowest calorie Japanese meals I make are: Okonomiyaki (cabbage pancake which is DELICOUS), Nabe (Japanese Hotpot), Gyudon (beef and rice bowl), Oyakodon (chicken, egg, and rice bow), Gyoza (Dumplings), and Just a lot of fresh fish especially salmon and tuna.

"  If you don't find another app, I honestly had a pretty good experience with loseit and myfitnesspal. Obviously not everything was in it, but a surprising amount of products. Entering the details yourself is pretty easy, especially on LoseIt, and you only have to do it once, so I never had a problem with it. If it's a product from a europe-wide grocery chain, I try looking it up both in english and in the countries language I bought it in, often times I find a match! 

Barcode scanning within the app can be super-super helpful too, I feel like myfitnesspal's scanner works better than LoseIt's (it's faster). Sometimes I can't find something in either of the languages, I scan it, and it's in the database but in slovakian or something. On loseit I just change the name to something I understand and it works like a charm!"
Cronometer is free and has a free scanner.  I know for myfitnesspal they put the scanner behind a pay wall for US residents.  It's the only reason I switched apps
Used to use myfitnesspal…switched to Cronometer
fatsecret
"Mfp, Loseit, lifesum, chronometer all have free versions with ads"
Cronotometer and myfitnesspal
I use lifesum. I love their interface and it’s really cute
"Mynetdiary. It has recipes for a variety of lifestyles/diets and you can view the ingredients but to actually view the steps you need the premium version. And you can manually log your own recipes and of course calories

Edit: people seem to like the little icons for foods and mynetdiary has those little icons as well"
"MFP is way less accurate than loseit with calorie counts, too."
It's easy in mfp
"I use loseit and if you go into recipes, click the one you want and if you click ""edit name and serving"" on the recipe on the website and then type in the number or on the app it'll be a scroll down menu at the top. Add how many servings/grams/cups whatever and it;ll average it out for you. This is how I survive"
"I use the loseit app and I log recipes as 12 servings, or however many. When you create a new recipe it gives you a spot to give it a name, under it it will say 1 serving. Click on the one and change it. When you log it in your food diary the first time it will load the entire recipe, change the number of servings to how many you had. For things like bread where not every slice you cut is equal weigh it after baking and log the grams as the serving number. So if it weighs 454g log it as 454 servings then it's super easy to figure out"
"Mine updates all the time and I haven't noticed any real change, except that instead of 1/4 1/3 1/2 3/4 portion choices they added 1/10 1/8 etc as well which I love. It doesn't make a huge difference really but it does make everything a bit more accurate. I did notice that beside the '1 serving' in the recipe builder there's a little downward facing triangle, not right beside the words but to the right of it, maybe you have to hit that instead of the 1 on yours. If you're trying on an existing recipe make sure you're at the edit recipe option.

I hate when updates change an app drastically. They ruined mfp to me. I had to always go on the browser instead which I found a bit of a pain so I switched to loseit after trailing off course. "
"I don't think there's best, depends where you are (to search for the products) and your diet.

Popular ones: My fitness pal, cronometer, carb manager, lose it!

Also good luck mate"
"I like cronometer because I like data, it has all my macros and micros. If too much data is going to be stressful myfitnesspal is super easy to use"
"i used to use my fitness pal religiously but a month or so ago made the switch to lose it and i wouldn’t ever switch back! they’re not wildly different, but lose it has a much more inviting look (to me) and feels more user friendly! i’d try downloading both and see which one you gravitate towards the most; that’s what i did when i first got curious about lose it, and found myself not opening mfp anymore!

one big drawback of lose it however is that you have to purchase the subscription in order to have the ability to plan meals for days ahead (you cannot go further ahead on the calendar than the current day). with my fitness pal this isn’t an issue! kind of annoying when i wanna plan a meal out in advance or something but not a huge deal for me, personally "
"I've used lose it and my fitness pal. those are pretty good. 

I am now using carb manager! that's been my fav so far!"
MFP! I like lose it more in every way except that you have to pay to plan ahead which I like to do the night before :)
I switched from mfp to loseit and like the whole setup of it more. I also find the data base more accurate. 
"that parts annoying me as well. MFP has more foods to choose from i think, too. but i do i like the serving sizes on loseit! better."
"oo thats interesting! mfp shows some nutrients, but not in depth like that. i think im anemic, i should really watch my iron :/"
"agreed, i havent found out how to do recipes on loseit yet."
I like fatsecret. Its a rip off of my fitness pal but it simpler to use. :)
I've used both and I'm happier using loseit. I like the recipe builder so much nicer.
"I suggest myfitness pal over lose it. I have used both and while using lose it, I noticed the calorie counts were off and they lacked the option to weigh in grams. I contacted their customer service who basically admitted their database is not accurate but they couldn't do much about that. 

with MyFitnessPal I'm currently down 54.5 pounds using just their free version."
"I used lose it when I was a freshman in college in 2015. I redownloaded it this year, and still get really annoyed when it tells me that I’ve gained 30lbs since 2015, even though I’ve lost 30 lbs since I downloaded it again. Other than that, I love lose it! I use the free version and I think it’s all you need."
I don’t have premium but I really like lose it it’s easy to use and they have quite a bit of options already logged
That’s what I was getting frustrated with..if you google “how to restart lose it app” it tells you how to start over.
"I like the 


I've learned about macros using the free version of FatSecret.](https://fatsecret.com/) .  It's easy to use. All you have to do is answer their questions.


 It guides you in planning macros, and automatically  calculates daily and weekly summaries of 14 macros/nutrients.  It g ability to pre-plan days, save meals, track weight, etc. It has free bar code scanning and no ads or pitches to upgrade.  [It's the API behind Amazon, FitBit, Lifescan, Samsung, etc.](https://platform.fatsecret.com/api/)"
I use fat secret. I really like it
"I'm a night shifter too and struggle the same way. I use lose it, but it doesnt let me pick when my day starts and ends - I dont want my calories to reset at midnight, I want it to be when my shift is over at 6am."
"TLDR; Cronometer is the best app for this but it could also be a good idea to learn how to interpret nutrition labels on your own


All you need to do is divide your portion by 100g and then multiply by the “per 100g” calorie amount. For example, if you eat 63g and the product says 400cal per 100g, you would do 63/100*400=252cal for your 63g portion. I recommend using the calculator app on your phone for the actual calculation. 


The same logic works for serving size- say the serving size is 28g and has 110 calories and you eat 44g, you would take 44/28*110=173cal for your portion. 


The general formula is (amount you ate) / (amount in a serving) * (calories per serving). It’s a good skill to learn to avoid mistakes, and just in general.


But if you think that’s too complicated and just want to plug something into an app, I would suggest Cronometer, because it’s database is the most accurate. Many people will suggest LoseIt or myfitnesspal, which both have their advantages, but also have a lot of entries with errors so I would not recommend using them if you can’t do the math yourself to make sure the entry you’re using is accurate."
"Loseit >>>> myfitnesspal

Left MFP after 5 years after I saw how great Loseit is. "
How does my fitness pal compare to lose it?
I use lose it but the new adds are so annoying!
Mynetdiary is my favorite and has a lot of functions. I always recommend it to anyone. I like the user interface better than myfitnesspal
yess!! i love mynetdiary but i feel like not many people use it!!
I love cronometer
I use myfitnesspal and when it doesn't have something with the measurements I want(grams) I add it from the fatsecret website. 
I love the bar code scan feature in the lose it app. This is my favorite app so far.
"There's the app see how you eat that people use to post their day on here. It has the pic and the calorie count right over the pic, but the app won't calculate get calories in the meal the person has to do that.

This concept would be amazing but it's impossible to guess accurately from a picture. Not only would there be no way for the app to know how much chicken is actually on the plate, it would have no way of knowing if it was baked plain or with 2 tbsp of oil on it which would add hundreds of calories to the dish. I use the loseit app which has a picture function. I can take a pic of my food and select the guess that matches. I took a pic of canned sliced peaches and got options ranging from potato wedges to oatmeal. Even if it guesses right you have to pick the right option then log the weight or amount you had "
I love loseit
I use my net diary. Love it.
"I use lifesum because its aesthetically nice and gentle (also it doesnt get upset at you if you ever stop logging, it just goes “hey i’d like to know about your delicious dinner!”). The downside to it is that a lot of the good features only come with a subscription"
This one is my favorite too! It looks so much cleaner than my fitness pal. I don't get why mfp is so popular. I'm having to use mfp right now for a group challenge and I miss net diary
"I also did a group thing that had me use mfp, very comparable so I figured it might’ve been a first thing I used is the one I preferred type thing, but I agree that the layout is cleaner overall."
Congrats hahaha 5 years is a LONG time (lose it on top😉)
"cronometer

myfitnesspal is ugly"
My Fitness Pal and LifeSum are both really good apps. I like MFP better but lifesum is still awesome.
"I use fatsecret and love it. I tried out a few of the other popular apps before deciding on this one. They all have pretty much the same features, so it just came down to which interface I liked the best."
myfitnesspal hands down. been using it every day for 2 years.
"Up  vote for loseit! Very easy to use, I like it much better than mfp"
"quite literally just eat 1200 calories daily (or a bit more depending), i use cronometer"
"I use myfitnesspal.

I try to avoid food made of flour (eg: noodle, pasta, bread, etc) as it is usually higher in calories and also my dna test state i am in high risk of getting celiac disease. 

As a Asian, i will try to have white rice (or brown rice if there is such option) for every meal so that i will feel full. Its easy for me to get rice for every meal as asian cuisine usually have this option.

I will have mcdonald once a week but i will opt for burger with no sauce, hot tea n small portion of fries. 

I eat 2 meals per day only to stay within 1200 calories limit."
"I use loseit! The database is kind of small, But since I mostly eat from scratch it has all the raw ingredients I could want, And if you have a packaged thing you can scan in the barcode and it'll put in the information.   I also find that it's calorie estimates are a tad more accurate for me, Most TDEE calculators have me a little low but loseit seems about right. 

&#x200B;

I'd say it's accurate as long as you're honest and are good at inputting the right portions, I've lost 5-6 pounds since I've started using it and it matches up with my deficit exactly."
"I use loseit too, and I have noticed some things I scan (not in US territory) show up with wrong info from time to time, so I recommend always checking the first time."
"Very popular ones i see are Loseit and myfitnesspal, but overall i would highly reccomend Cronometer as top tier above all. 

I personally use carb manager but that's because im use to the interface and never switched aps after quitting keto"
loseit
The my plate app lets you put in recipes so you don't have to add up individual ingredients and has a barcode scanner.  Not familiar with mfp and if it does the same.  It also has reminders to enter meals.
I suggest the app “lose it!” I like tracking my calories on it way more:)
"Apps like loseit, or myfitnesspal, have a recipe builder. You weigh the ingredients as you cook then add them to the app. Set the number of servings and it calculates the calories in your meal. It's a bit time consuming the first time, but the next time you make it it's already saved. You'd still want to weigh as you cook so it's the same nutritionally but you can pull the recipe up on the app and use it as your cookbook as you cook plus alter it in any way you need. Like if you used 100g cheese for your recipe before but only used 90g this time it takes a second to change it but it's easy peasy.

There's no real trick, but the recipe builder functions are great when you cook your own meals regularly. 

Lots of things don't need the recipe builder and you'd use the regular long. Like I did chicken, broccoli, and a baked potato. I weighed each of those and logged them. Then I quickly logged the butter I used, and the balsamic vinegar I used on the chicken. Seasonings like garlic powder have so few calories you don't really need to worry about it, I only add them when I use the recipe builder so I can recreate the recipe easily."
"I was a Noom user!
I unfortunately had a less than stellar experience with their food/diet counselor they assign when you become a paid member, so I didn't use that particular aspect of their service for long, but I do like the app.

I can confirm that you CAN track calories without the attached service of the counselor (who is there for accountability and goal setting, so if you can do those things yourself -- all the better). I did like the interface a lot -- ended up switching off of it only because I really wanted the macros (which my current app, lifesum, does in a roundabout way).

(edit to add: the app and calorie tracking is free; if you pay a monthly fee, that is when you get a counselor and a series of wellness articles to help you change your mentality re: food)."
Moved to cronometer after MFP took away their barcode scanner and am finally feeling like I have fully adjusted. Hoping they don't try and move it behind a pay wall!
"So far, bar code scanning is still free on  [FatSecret.](https://fatsecret.com/.) Visually, it is clean with no pop-ups, ads, or pitches to upgrade to paid. 


 The free version  has also has daily and weekly summaries of 14 macros/nutrients,  ability to pre-plan days, save meals, track weight, etc. I'm told it has a good international database of foods. It's the API behind Amazon, FitBit, Lifescan, Samsung, etc."
"While many people here will suggest food scales, and are absolutely not wrong, it's not impossible to do it without a food scale. Your recorded amounts will not be nearly as accurate compared to using a food scale, but if you either don't want to purchase one or can't afford to, it's possible to lose weight without a food scale. Personally, I use myfitnesspal (free version). I'm an avid baker so I have a fairly good idea of what certain amounts look like on a plate and just ballpark. I also am not super strict like some people are and allow myself some leeway and some maintenance days here and there where again, everything is ballparked. There is no 1 correct answer, you just have to find out what works for you."
Another vote for lose it. My fitness pal was too complicated for me
"I'm sorry you think this is unpleasant. I don't believe there was any miscommunication. I do think you have moved around a bit on which point you're trying to argue.

Again, OP was feeling bad because her husband wasn't being supportive of her counting calories. All she wanted was a measurement of the total product. He proceeded to give her a hard time about it and she was upset. She came here to vent and get support. She eats this item regularly with her husband. He makes it. She has logged it based on a store bought product in the past. She just wanted to be a little more accurate this time around. It was a reasonable ask with an unreasonable reaction.

Your response to that was to tell her to be more intuitive about her eating. For her to estimate her calories. You even talked at one point about eyeing calorie counts in muffins. 

Not everyone can do this. She expressly pointed out in her post that calorie counting is what works for her. Not everyone can sacrifice 100 calories here and there. Nor does everyone want to.

Furthermore, judging by the way your clothes fit can be fine for some. It's not for others. Sometimes if your clothes don't fit, it's a battle to get back on track.

I am not saying your recommendations are completely wrong in a general sense. They are just wrong here. Some people follow your philosophy and it works for them and that's awesome. Theoretically, you should try to get to a point where your eating habits are sustainable. What is sustainable is different for everyone. Some people literally want to log 312. 

This is a sub where people are trying to stay in a certain calorie range. Telling them to guess at what their intake is counterproductive. Your advice is way more appropriate for r/loseit or something like that."
"I’ve lost 100 pounds with loseit and a cheap 20 year old weight watchers food scale.  I tried MFP, but I like they layout of loseit better, and MFP seems to have a lot more issues with being down.  I felt the inaccuracies to be about the same for both.

I don’t think it matters too much which you use as long as you’re being consistent."
"I like Cronometer because every food item has a grams option which works great paired with my food scale. And also because they verify each new food to confirm the nutritional information is correct. I lost with MFP in the past, then cronometer after my first baby, and now using Cronometer again after having my second."
"See I wouldn't have noticed if I didn't use both Lose It and My fitness pal for a week. When I'm working on my actual food prep recipes the my fitness pal is just WAY more accurate. and I can't get lose it down to the gram on anything for weighing which just doesn't work for my meals preps at all. 

I weigh everything, just seeing the difference in data after using both I was confused. Depending on the item it can be a huge difference."
It took some getting used to to type the codes but they have an app so you just search the food in the app and it gives you the code which makes everything a lot quicker. It really helped me because I would be looking up things like avocado in the lose it app which would say half an avocado is 160 calories but with the scale I realized I was only eating 70 calories of avocado at a time even though I thought it was half.
It works like a regular scale and you can track calories by inputting a regular scales food weight in to an app like lose it but I like this one because it also shows nutritional value and daily % since I find that on apps like lose it sometimes those are inaccurate.
Swap to cronometer
I really like loseit app. I’d always used mfp and just switched. I’m sure they lost a lot of money with their full page ads and loss of scanner. So stupid. I do have the premium lose it app but it was super cheap and I really like it! Also gives me motivation to use it since I’m paying for it
"I switched to loseit, it took a few days to get used to it, but I haaaaated the fact the MFP got rid of scanning. LoseIt does have a “premium” level as well, and I bought a lifetime membership when they offered it to me for $80 since I had been tracking for 3+ years of MFP. I just…I lost all that data and it kinda burns."
"Yep, and I’m never going back. I use Lose it! All the features that a free user would typically use on mfp is on there except tracking things like sodium (which I would do) otherwise, it’s pretty great. I find the UI much better and modern and also the best part when scanning a food that it doesn’t know it automatically fills in the info to create the food."
I use cronometer and love it
cronometer!
I love lose it! It’s been my go to for some time now.
"I switched to cronometer after the mfp barcode thing and I love it SO much. It's so much easier to use my own recipes with the way they use the by-weight feature.

Oh! And you can scan ingredients into your recipes too, which is amazing."
I have been using lose it since 2014 and I’ve always loved it.
I use loseit! But I always try to go by grams and weigh everything :)
"Actually I think sometimes these problems are more internal and psychological than just calorie counting. It might certainly help to be more on track with myfitnesspal and meal prepping and such, but I think it is also important to pay more attention to your mental health and self care. Eating shouldn’t be an emotional outlet and that’s not establishing a good relationship with food. I think as you improve your internal problems these food problems would go away too. We are all here for you and I hope you will get back on track soon! Good luck :)"
"I'm definitely going to be the odd man out on this one... I use Waistline and participate in OpenFoodFacts. They do not have the vast databases that MFP or loseit or cronometer have, but they are privacy friendly and 100% free without advertising. If you are passionate about the freedom of health and nutrition information, and about privacy rights, I strongly recommend participating in OpenFoodFacts. They need volunteers to scan barcodes and enter nutritional info!"
i LOVE lifesum!! imo its the best
I use cronometer and absolutely love it because it gives me an idea of how I'm doing nutrition-wise as well!
"I like myfitnesspal. I think I like it more because I've been using it for a LONG time. I tried lost it and didn't like it, but I  think it's because I 'm just so used to MFP. I think I started using it in 2012. I don't think their premium version is worth it."
"i've always used mfp.  
I love it because you have a huuuge database of food. Even if you live in small countries. You add however many meals you like and change the names (meal 1, snack 1, breakfast etc). You can see your macros and add some of your favorites. Like iron, calcium or sodium. You can also connect it to fitbit and heaps of other apps. You can edit recipes or whole meals. Most foods have measurements for 100gr, 1 gr, 1 tea spoon, 1 table spoon etc.  You can log your excercises and it adds extra calories to your daily allowence. And much more! I currently use the free version, not sure if the paid version is worth it. Maybe if you want different calorie goals per day."
I like my fitness pal over lose it because of the nutrition info display. also like saving my recipes
My fitness pal & lose it are the best apps in my opinion
"I use cronometer. If you want a free website to do so, check https://foodstruct.com.
Make sure to select correct description of food. For example 50g raw chickpea, is 150g after cooking but both have the same calories."
I use cronometer and it is really nice!
"I use lose it, it's not perfect but it works."
"I really like carb manager. It has the best variety or foods and measurement options. I used cronometer when I first started counting and was interested in nutrition because it breaks down your vitamins and all that, but it has less food items then carb manager.ir also has a pie chart of your macros"
Lots of people use myfitnesspal but it relies on crowdsourced data and so can be inaccurate sometimes. It’s the Wikipedia of calorie counting apps. Chronometer doesn’t have this problem but I believe does not have as extensive list of foods because of this.
I am using my macros+ but a personal trainer that I was going to use did recommend the cronometer app too.
"I love myfitnesspal. It know almost all the foods (even though I live in Belgium). I first started out with the fitbit app (because I have a fitbit), but it was so insufficient and I had to add almost all the foods myself. Myfitnesspal is really the way to go. 

Though, you should pay attention when adding something that it is correct. Users can add stuff without someone checking if it is correct so sometimes I find foods that are entered falsly. Luckily it is very easy to alter them :) 

What I like most is that I can say I want to eat the same breakfast as yesterday. So everything is added at once but I can alter it if something changed today.
(I eat yoghurt with muesli and fruit. The fruit changes a lot and the amount of muesli, so pretty nice to be able to pick yesterday's breakfast and just make small alterations)"
"I use myfitnesspal, You can just scan the products for the nutrition info and I can even save my own meals and recipes for later use. This is just great in combination with mealprepping."
"Ive used myfitnesspal for the past 4 years, logging in every single day. Unfortunately the ease of use doesnt make up for all the bugs and how expensive premium is. If they lowered the cost of premium and fixed some problems i wouldnt mind sticking with it but for now i stick with chronometer"
"A dedicated loseit user since 2014 - I find it to be more customizable  than MFP. And if you email them, you can get half off premium."
"Does it have a lot of items from the store, and the specific brands like MyFitnessPal does? I know Cronometer has much more info about the nutrition that’s why I consider switching but MFP is just so convenient wir the ability to scan products. Can I do that on cronometer too?"
"been using mfp for like 8 years and have never once needed premium, js."
"Everything. It has the same database.

Recipes are easier to make

You can copy certain meals or full days

It's a COACH. You choose a goal, fat loss, gain, maintenance, reverse diet. Check in weekly and it literally changes your macros and tells if you have gained or lost too much.. Also takes into account if you are close to menstrual cycle. It also asks what rate. So right now I've been in a 6m surplus gaining 0.3kg per week. If i lose, it ups my cals, gain too much, decreases.

You can also have higher days and lower days. I tell it i want weekend higher days, so it changes the rest of the week to account for this.

Its 100 times whar mfp is. Including the premium."
"I usually still plan ahead on loseit. After breakfast, I usually input what I plan to have for dinner so I can see how many calories I can consume during the day"
"They have said they don't do free trials because of how little it's priced anyway. 

To me, it's well worth the money- especially if you can't afford a coach.

10 pound a month is a steal for what you get  tops mfp by a mile!"
"I use cronometer. It's not the path of least resistance. At the end of the day, if you want to track your calories it's going to take effort on your part to do it every day consistently - there's no way around that. There is no app that exists that will do it for you.

Another option is you pick a macro that is either your priority or your nemisis. So for example:

* if you want to be sure to get 128g of protein every day - then just track your protein intake and eat your proteins first - the premise being if you fill up on protein you won't be hungry for other things. OR
* if carbs are your downfall then only track your net carbs so you're not exceeding your daily limit

For this you can use pen and paper."
I use loseit free version but have used the paid version in the past and it was definitely more convenient. Once you track meals for a few weeks it's pretty easy to just type a generic approximation of your meal into search and you'll get some result that shouldn't be more than 100 calories off what you ate. Not perfect but better than you giving up and doing nothing that day!
I pay for loseit premium it allows you to pre-log all your meals. Some days when I know what every meal is while I eat breakfast I just log it all then and there
"Free MyNetDiary app for healthy weight loss: https://www.mynetdiary.com/shareapp

EZ PZ keep your apple green and it will work. Don’t get hung up on a single day of red/orange but look at the overall trend. Also, don’t forgot exercise."
"My point was if you view tracking food in an app as user friendly as myfitnesspal or something similar, it’s likely you aren’t putting the appropriate effort in other places either. Your way of thinking has to shift."
I use this app and it’s worked well for me. I set my goal and the date I want to achieve it; just keep the apple 🍏 green. My biggest challenge for tracking is eating out  [My Net Diary](https://www.mynetdiary.com/shareapp)
"There's an app where u can literally take pics of your food plate and the app guesstimates the kcals and macros. But ofcourse, this would be quite a bit inaccurate and unreliable. Especially with hidden fats, oils, etc.

I still feel your best bet is an app like cronometer. Where you have a large database. But u can also make your own custom meals that you frequently eat. Its worth the investment in time. The app is free. Hope that helps!"
You can also quick add specific calories in the lose it app and name it. I do that when I go out to eat
I love how I can just scan the barcode and/or multi-select items. Definitely many things make me glad I switched from MyFitnessPal to cronometer.
"> and the app guesstimates the kcals and macros. But ofcourse, this would be quite a bit inaccurate and unreliable. Especially with hidden fats, oils, etc.  
>  
>I still feel your best bet is an app like cronometer. Where you have a large database. But u can also make your own custom meals that 

What's the name of the app?"
thanks to everyone who posted replies to this. i figured out how to do it in myfitnesspal and it's working well!
"On both lose it and chronometer you can add protein/other goals and swipe between them on the day-food-diary-summary view. I generally keep mine on protein and then manually look at calories if I want to, but the option exists to set it up to not see the cals (though I’ve never seen the ability to completely disable cals and not have them easily available if you want to see them)"
Lose it has a vast food database. Way better than mfp from what I can tell
"I use MyFitnessPal. I’ve used other apps, such as cronometer, but always end up going back to MFP. It has a larger library, even though you have to aware that a lot of it is inaccurate. I can count on it being close enough to make mental adjustments as I eat throughout the day. It definitely is not the best option for vitamins and minerals though. Even if they did provide tracking for those, I would highly doubt the accuracy, which is muy importante when dealing with vitamins and minerals. 

I personally use the app for calories in vs out, protein intake and keeping an eye on sodium and sugar intake. Everything else I just try to get it in through out the day one way or any other. It’s a work in progress."
"I don't see fatsecret recommended on reddit very often, but it's the site I use. 

I find MFP to be too slow, and a lot of the food in the database doesn't have the option for grams which is pretty much the only way I track calories. 

Fatsecret also doesn't have any advertisements which is important to me. I also like the green instead of the blue lol. "
"What apps are you using? A lot of these apps are user supported, so the food/nutrient/calorie info may not be accurate. Using those apps would be like using Wikipedia for verified quality source.

"Counter point.  I hated myfitnesspal after 2 years of using it but love Loseit. Found it’s just wayyyy faster and cleaner. 

- get a scale.  Calorie counting is not even worth it without a scale.  They are cheap.  
- log in grams. It’s more granular.  There can be a lot of calories in a .1 of an ounce.  
- don’t log veggies.  Yes they are calories but I find the “reward” of what feels like free calories encourages me to eat them more.  Snack on some cucumbers. Yes please.  If I missed adding 100 calories because I ate a bunch of carrots and tomatoes so be it.  
- if you have to pull an estimate out of thin air estimate high especially if it’s a restaurant.  
- I find skipping breakfast makes it much easier to not over eat.  Having 2 medium sized meals to me is far easier than 3 small meals.   It also means less calorie logging and less likely to burn out doing it. 
- put in recipes for things you commonly eat.  I have recipes for everything.  My smoothie, omelets, salads I like.  If you have to add ten items every time you make a smoothie it’s more likely one day you’ll be in a rush and just skip it then your day is off and you stop logging.  Making your most tedious log entries a single item helps A LOT.  Also, makes it easier to stick to your hopefully heathy recipes.  Some days I might want to add 50grams of cheese to my salad because I’m craving it by my recipe calls for 25 and I really don’t want to update  it or add more so I’ll just to 25. 
- If your spouse cooks but doesn’t calorie count get a post it note and pen in the kitchen so they can drop down items and weights so I can calculate it while eating.  
- I connect Garmin to Lose it and love seeing my budget go up when I work out hard.  It’s all automatic so just log my workout and loseit adds the calories in.  It will even adjust my daily activity level with my exercise to try to be more accurate 
- Sometimes I’ll log my next meals calories before I eat.  Helps me stick to it knowing I won’t have to do anything in the app if I don’t add food or change it up.  Using my laziness to do the right thing.  
- Once you have a target calorie level and are being honest about calories eat up to that level.  If you are doing 1800 calories a day and you are only at 1200 after dinner try to bring it up closer to 1800.  I find every time  I’m way under my limit for the day I end up falling off a day or two later.  Keeping it consistent makes it easier for me to keep going. 
- When I’m really lazy I might do things like just add a sandwich from a restaurant instead of logging all the items in the sandwich I made.  Like if I made a BLT at home but I didn’t measure anything because I’m lazy or in a rush I’ll just find a BLT from a restaurant and add it but make it definitely higher than my own. If I guess mine was around 500 I’ll pick one that’s 700.  That way I “reward” myself by taking the time to be accurate with a larger budget.  
-oh and you might feel like going over your goal too demotivating to log it.  Do it anyways.  Your goal should be accuracy first.  I’ve had days I went 1000 calories over and still logged it.  I’d rather know that just turn a blind eye.  

A theme you might have noticed is that I try to make doing the right thing the easy and rewarding thing and having my laziness motivate me.  Works for me but maybe not you."
"That's what I do on myfitnesspal. Thing is when your final recipe contains a lot of water like beans. In myfitnesspal, I list each dry ingredient's weight in grams and for 'number of servings' I put the sum of all ingredients in grams. And when  I have to log I just weigh my portion again and put that number as my servings for the meal. It's all good when your final cooked recipe has most of the water evaporated. But when you have water I think it's weight will also be reflected in those grams when I will be portioning so calories would be a little exaggerated won't they?"
[Cronometer](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cronometer-nutrition-tracker/id1145935738) is great for this.
definitely cronometer. it doesn’t trigger my ED like MFP does (you’ve gone over today’s calories ! this contains 6g of fat ! like shut up lmao) it’s just like “hey you get a lot of nutrients good job” so that’s nice
Try www.myfitnesspal.com
I think [Cronometer.com](http://cronometer.com) will do all that. It can get pretty specific with caloric and nutrition content.
YES!  Thank you.  This is exactly what I hoped to find.  I have been using myfitnesspal for months but it doesn't let me drop in a whole recipe at one time to get caloric info.  
"it has a huge database, so pretty much all chains and other popular restaurants have their nutritional data from the menu on myfitnesspal. you just search 'subway spicy Italian footlong' or whatever you're eating, and it'll most likely have it in there"
"As others have already said in this thread [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) is great for tracking micro-nutrients of your diet. It uses several databases, including the USDA database. It provide you with the possibility to create your own recipes and add to your diary. 

However, Cronometer lacks the possibility to compare multiple food items. If you want to compare nutrients in different food items, then I would recommend [Nutrition Calculator](https://nutritioncalculator.net/). It uses the data from the USDA database, and has good and clean charts for comparing nutrients in different food items. You can also create your own recipes and see their nutritional information.

MyFitnessPal is good if you only care about macro-nutrients, as they have limited data on the vitamins and minerals of the items in their database."
"I really like the free version of cronometer, the only feature I miss is items separated by meal such as breakfast, lunch, dinner. Otherwise it's been perfect more me. Thanks for putting in the time for this. "
"Amazing review! Thanks for sharing. Personally, I hate the picture based display of Wholesome. I'd rather just have text to quickly read. 

I personally use cronometer and think it's definitely worth it as an app. One feature I especially love about cronometer is the ability to add multiple Notes to each log. So I can write if a food upset my stomach, or if there was a reason my weigh-in was higher than usual, or a list of my vitamins I take, or if I was feeling sick that day, etc. Great for little reminders or observations. "
"Cronometer added a feature to include photos in your diary a few weeks ago:  
[https://cronometer.com/blog/adding\-photos\-to\-diary\-notes/](https://cronometer.com/blog/adding-photos-to-diary-notes/)"
" [https://cronometer.com/](https://cronometer.com/)  is pretty good for tracking what you eat, where you also can see what micro-nutrients you get from the food you are eating.  

 [https://nutritioncalculator.net/](https://nutritioncalculator.net/) is pretty good if you want to compare the nutrients for different foods. You can also create recipes and compare the nutrient profile of them.

I have also used MyFitnessPal back in the days when all I cared about was the macros. It was great for tracking calories and macros, but it lacks the functionality of being able to see the micro-nutrients."
"I have found  [https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/](https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/)  to be ok as well as  [https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/](https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/)     
I am hoping this  [https://world.openfoodfacts.org/](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)  gets better but it's a more open source of a list"
i use “lose it” and i’ve had good success with it.
"Check out calorie king. I use myfitnesspal, but agree with you. Anything that isn't the same as what I find on the label I create a food entry using calorie king. Allows you to do everything in grams or ounces, whatever your preference is."
Maybe cronometer? It tracks macros as well as micronutrients and seems geared towards whole foods.
"I made my own spreadsheet in Google sheets, so I can access it at home, work, or wherever. I have a sheet with all the foods I expect to eat, and another sheet with a week's worth of days that I fill out as I eat. I use vlookup to pull the numbers from the foods sheet (but I've heard an index function is better). I like having full control of the information shown - for example, I could add a fruit/veggie/dairy column right next to the calorie column if I wanted. It took a little while to create it, but I'm pretty happy with it and prefer it to mfp, etc."
"Thanks for the response -  you can do macros on loseit as well (which i preferred aesthetically to fitnesspal) but I'm looking for the categories above (differentiation of fruit/veggie/dairy, etc). , instead of just the 3 - carbs, protein and fat. 
I guess similar to an app that might provide a checklist for people who take multiple medications or need other repeated reminders daily."
you can set all targets to 0 in cronometer
"I like www.cronometer.com

You can do weight loss/gain, but if you're interested in tracking nutrients, there is tons of information.  It's also got a web version if you're not smartphone friendly.

Just be aware though that certain nutrients (e.g. iodine, omega 3s) are very poorly listed and you won't find good data in databases (all based on the USDA database) for them.  It's not a fault of the tracker, it's just not commonly taken.  So for those, a bit of googling will tell you iodine is in seaweed and vegan sources of omega 3s are flax/hemp/chia seeds."
"Believe it or not, myfitnesspal can actually be used to ensure you're either consuming a caloric surplus or eating at your daily maintenance. If you go online using your computer, you can adjust your macro-nutrient intake goals, sugar/sodium intake, and track micro-nutrients as well. The app is definitely designed for those losing weight, but I've done just fine using it to bulk and ensure proper micro/macro intake. "
Best one I've found is www.cronometer.com. 
"The best macro tracker would be www.myfitnesspal.com, they have a HUGE database of foods and after using it for about a month it pretty much uses itself...and they have a mobile app. The problem with tracking micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) is that the actual amount in a given volume of food varies based off of a number of factors, including how the food was grown/raised."
"myfitnesspal tracks vitamin a, vitamin c, calcium, and iron but the daily totals will not be accurate so take it with a silo of salt."
This (cronometer) is pretty great for what you get for free and it goes down pretty granular details so will probably hit what you want. Plus it is still pretty easy to use from experience.
"You should visit /r/loseit and /r/fitness, read the FAQ and lurk a bit. 

Your body likes the weight it is at, it will lose weight only if you *consistently* eat under your TDEE. 

On the flip side, you can't only take in 600 calories a day and exercise on top of that. Although you might lose weight dramatically, you will crash after a short period and go back to binge eating. 

You have the same problem most of the population has. /r/loseit should be a good place to start, just read other's posts and comments and you will learn you are not alone and read great tips on how to lose weight and get fit!
"
"You're probably underestimating how many calories you're eating. You may want to get a food scale, since at 5'1"" even a small variance can make a difference.

Also, myfitnesspal cuts off at 1200 calories.  You have a small frame anyways, so you can probably go below that amount and still be eating enough every day. I know you have a deadline, but one pound a week is a lot, so you may want to try slower weight loss.  Good luck!"
