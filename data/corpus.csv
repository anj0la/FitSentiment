I will forever be a fan of cronometer but I've heard a lot of good things about macrofactor. They cost money but it's less expensive than a lot of premium subscriptions to other tracking apps
Hi there! Our sincerest apologies for any issues you're experiencing with MyFitnessPal. Our team is always happy to assist! Please send an email to [support@myfitnesspal.com](mailto:support@myfitnesspal.com) for further help. Thank you!
"I think most, if not all calorie trackers would be good for weight gain. 

The one I use is cronometer, which let's you set your desired weight gained per week. Cronometer also let's you see the macro or micronutrients you might be missing in the free version.

I've heard only good things about macrofactor, but it does cost money (still less expensive than MyFitnessPal premium I believe)"
"myfitnesspal does!

not many people know how to use this feature but if you go to more > settings > sharing & privacy > diary sharing > and set to friends only or public...you should be able to go to more > friends > click profile > and click diary icon

hope this helps :)"
"[https://cronometer.com/](https://cronometer.com/) still has a free version with a lot of features (macro tracking, bar code scanner, etc)."
I use lifesum. Has a barcode scanner for free too
"Free Loseit has all of the features you need. But for $20 for a year… loseits premium features are nice and decently affordable. Tracking macros, nutritions strategies, planning meals days ahead, etc"
"I have been using the free version of cronometer for a few months. I'm satisfied with it.

There are several other free options available for you to try out."
I know a lot of people use myfitnesspal but I personally use the Fitbit app which allows you to just input the calories if you want to as well as the option to search for food and scan barcodes etc
"I looove lose it!! I tried my fitness pal, but lose it just worked better for me. I found it easier to log foods and set goals. Idk, just my 2 cents :)"
"My fitness pal or lose it are very simple and user friendly! my fitness pal for the minimalist, lost it is a little bit more fun. I also recommend carrot! this app is strict and a lot of fun. The AI interacts with you and you have an avatar that starts off as a skeleton, and becomes obese if you overeat."
I use Glimmer app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loseit.glimmer
"I used my fitness pal for a long time. It's intuitive and has a large selection of calorie counted food so it makes using it VERY easy. 

Hooewwweever I just recently started using lose it! And I love it!!! I like the layout better and the section of calorie counted food is still very good. I also love that it breaks up my calories into the different meals. So if I have a 400 cal breakfast it distributes my remaining calories to the other meals. So I know exactly how much I can/should eat for snacks and dinner."
"you can do these exact things on myfitnesspal. you just have to add each other as friends and make sure your diary settings are set of visible by friends. then you can go to each others log book for any day and view each others entry's 

as for recipes, you can also do that on myfitnesspal, its super simple"
"Wait, is the app called ""loseit?"""
"lose it allows barcodes and visual tracking of your weight loss. 
i also got a year premium for £13"
"I have lose it too, you should type in the brand name instead of barcode scanning it. Most times you will find a grams/oz version. If not, just find a similar brand with the same amount of calories per serving that you see on the bag :)"
"I also just use the FitBit app/website.  I don't let it calculate my calorie needs based on my exercise; I tell it what my daily calorie goal is.  It doesn't have the bells and whistles that other apps have, but it works well for my purposes.  Because it allows user created entries, I usually double check against product packaging or USDA website and edit or create my own entries when necessary.

Other options are [Chronometer](https://cronometer.com/) and [LoseIt](https://www.loseit.com/).  

The specific app is less important than figuring out your [TDEE or maintenance calories](https://tdeecalculator.net/), and tracking well enough to be reasonably sure you're eating less than that on average each day.  As long as you eat less than your TDEE more days than not, you'll lose weight.  Good luck!"
"This is such a great start, and love thinking about this reverse. Can't wait to see how it progresses with either

1. simple food logging experience you integrate into the web page
2. or turned into a plug-in i can add into myfitnesspal"
"I just installed Lifesum a few days ago, and it's really neat. It's very simple and well designed, with none of that social media stuff myfitnesspal does."
"On r/loseit there are periodic challenges where you are put on a team that competes against other teams. Weight loss and fitness levels are tracked weekly for 6 weeks. You can use your Fitbit to log exercise and have the support of your team. It isn’t a competitive calorie counting app,  but you can regularly count your calories on whatever app you choose and then use that to assist in completion or competition between you cams your friend. 

Edit: a completion in starting soon if you are interested. An initial post will be made tomorrow with more info "
I like lose it. I just wished it also had a weight gain/maintenance option even tho that defeats the purpose of the name 😭
"I used to use fatsecret. Their search and food entry and meal creation functions were a lot more polished and complete than myfitnesspal. But the site's on life support, features breaking or disappearing, forums overrun with spam, and they deleted my account with all my diary and recipes and shit for complaining about it(but the russian gambling site ads and fake rolex and internet viagra and crypto scammers and so on posting every day stay up.) Definitely wouldn't recommend, it's not going to be there in five years."
"With apps like myfitnesspal or Cronometer they automatically count your macros, but I really only look at protein"
"I really like cronometer. They do include user submitted entries, but it seems that they hold true to reviewing them because I rarely find a deviation from the label on scanned items. MFP was all over the place for me, and I hated it."
"You can do that in Chronometer! You have to have the pro version but one year is only 34.99$ (which for an app I use every single day felt worth it to me as there are other features offered I wanted like grouping of my foods and such)

Personally; I LOVE the app. Not quite as popular as myfitnesspal but I find the calorie counts to be more accurate and most entries have the option to enter the exact grams eaten instead of having to do a bunch of crazy math with converting your measured amount into the number of servings eaten like in most apps)

EDIT: you can also connect a variety of devices including your fitbit! I wanted to double check!"
"cronometer. you can use features that most apps make you pay for, from barcodes to macros to micronutrients, pretty user friendly too"
I also use the calorie counter app by fatsecret.com and I have also wished I could just add some calories especially when the barcode scanner doesn't find the particular food item.
"Me too, I'm very fond of it! Caloriecounter (on the other hand) judges your food choices and I hate that. If I decide I'd prefer a higher fat lower carb/processed food diet, I'd rather not see that caloriecounter judges butter as a ""D"" food. But I have no complaints whatsoever about myfitnesspal."
You can add your own foods on the fatsecret.com website then they should be available in the mobile app.
"I should give that a try, sometimes i feel like i need some extra deterrent from sweets on account of perma-sweet tooth. 

Off the tip of my head, the only thing that I wish were different with mfp, was background syncing when you start the app instead of in the foreground. that's mainly because I don't use the website really, unless I'm putting in a recipe or something."
"You can add foods in the [LoseIt](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lose-it!/id297368629?mt=8) app (also [on Android](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.fitnow.loseit&hl=en), and [the web](http://www.loseit.com/) and you can also add recipes made up of other food items.  It has barcode scanning (and matching with foods you've added yourself or for some reason aren't properly matched automatically).  It interfaces with FitBit, like MyFitnessPal, and generally has worked pretty well for me."
"I weigh and record each ingredient to get macros for the finished product. 

I then divide this by the weight of the finished meal so that I have calories/fat/protein/carbs per gram and use this as the serving information in myfitnesspal.

Then weigh each meal and record."
"I really like lose it, the only real annoying things is its constantly asking you to upgrade to premium. That being said it has a lot of the same functions as myfitnesspal minus the social media aspect and gives you realistic comparisons when you loose weight. I.e I hit the 30 lbs mark today and it is the equivalent of carrying around a 4 gallon jug of water constantly.  The biggest tips I can give you is count every thing even if it's a bite of something or not a full serving and if you have to guess then over estimate dont short change it."
"You get better at guesstimating. I normally think like well if I go get pizza that's probably 300 a slice. I get ramen probably 1,000 calories for the whole thing. I get sushi I find something similar on mfp. The big thing is keep trying and don't stress yourself to much. You've got this, and it gets easier the more you do it. Don't be afraid to enjoy a nice dinner sometimes!"
"because that's the entire point of the sub. if you're looking for more in depth information about people's journey with calorie counting then you should join r/cico or r/loseit 
this sub is a lovely community where we don't judge someone for asking about calories, even if it is just in a ""slice of pizza."" we know google is available, but having varying opinions from all kinds of people, regarding oil counts, types of tomato sauce, cheese style, and portion size is extremely helpful and sometimes google isn't enough"
"I genuinely thought the point of this community was to debate/ help with calorie count of items - including simple - complex and also potentially some straightforward ways to reduce along the way. There are loads of forums for advice and support on weight loss in general (r/CICO r/loseit r/weightlossadvice r/1500isplenty to name but a few). Also getting a wide range of estimates and going with the average/highest, perhaps with some Googling to input, is a valid way to get good guidance."
"Get a food scale and find entries in lose it or my fitness pal (preferably in grams). Weigh and track everything. If you don’t know how many calories something has, go for the entry with the highest calories, just to be safe."
"I've actually been put off by loseit! After using it a year, it's database seems to be getting worse and it's a pain to find the right item. Is mfp any better?"
"I've tried both and prefer lose it. The interface is better in my opinion and I always found MFP would glitch. (I'd enter breakfast and come back 3 hrs later to enter lunch and my breakfast would be tripled, or disappear entirely). I actually found the database to be more accurate in lose it than mfp, but with that said I generally eat the same things so I don't have to stray too far to find what I'm looking for, so it could be an issue that I just don't experience. Also Fitbit can only be linked if you pay for it, whereas it's free with MFP."
I don’t have one either so I usually just go with the larger estimate on the lose it app:/ also use google to search what a certain amount of food looks like and use the photos to reference and get a better estimate. I’m still losing weight so I’m sure I’m probably only off by a couple hundred calories at most but honestly I’m probably going to get a scale soon. I think it will make my life easier and who knows I could be eating way less than I think I am because of overestimating.
"My best tools...

* MyFitnessPal (MFP) to count intake.  
* http://calorielab.com/burned/ to estimate exercise (enter the ""additional calories"" result in MFP)
* Digital kitchen food scale to estimate food

I had a FitBit.  It wasn't bad.  I liked MFP and my own exercise accounting better because sometimes FitBit's proprietary algorithm got a little hard to take on faith -- but, over the long term (9 months of usage), I can't say it was far off.  In fact, I'd say it was within 100 Calories daily of my own numbers.

"> Does monitoring and sticking to calorie goals really result in weight loss?

Yes

> So can I lose the weight watching calories alone or do i need to exercise?

You can lose the weight from controlling your intake calories alone, but you need to exercise to be fit and healthy.  If you are unfit and overly fat, you will later be unfit and not overly fat.

and /r/loseit is the best subreddit for weight loss via calorie counting.  

My own advice is this -- 

Your HABITS made you heavy, your HABITS will eventually keep you at your goal weight, so it's your HABITS that are most important.   Therefore, calorie counting provides light and information into what your habits are doing, but it's your habits that ought to be your focus.  Keep tracking calories through all of this, even when you want to quit or the day's goals are long blown -- keep tracking.  Repetition is how habits and expectations get formed. 

This is simple but it is hard because it involves our life's habits and expectations and practices and favorites.   **It's okay to struggle and even fail** as long as you don't quit.  Just keep trying.  There is no growth without failure and analysis, so don't waste time feeling guilty or disappointed when it happens, just accept it as part of the process and that better performance comes with more practice.

"Finally got into trying to maintain a proper diet and am now trying to record what I consume on the myfitnesspal app. (Those who've been doing this for a while have my utmost respect considering how tedious this process can be)

However, I've been having trouble in noting down some of the stuff that I have from outside. So like, for instance, I had Kabulli tikkay with a friend today and managed to clean off approximately 21 skewers by myself. I've attached the pic as well of what they look like (Essentially one skewer contains 3 beef cubes and 1 lamb fat cube).

Now the problem is that I'm not sure just how to record this into the app. I've found a [recipe](http://www.pakladies.com/afghani-tikka-recipe/) online but I'm not sure just how much 21 skewers translates into how many kg of beef. Any advice will be greatly appreciated"
Scan the barcode on mfp
"Yes, if you're cooking with unprocessed ingredients this is how you do it.

 Most inputs are for raw weight on apps like myfitnesspal. You don't have to specify raw, the macros and weights are calculated for how you bought the product. You'd only really need to specify for cooked, if you weighed it after it was cooked."
"at fatsecret.com on the foods I've added it asks how much one serving is and I use grams... so for instance 31 grams = 1 serving. It makes it a litte more work say when you have 45 grams of something then you have to do the math and put in the result like 45/31=1.45 servings.

I have noticed on some generic things like ""cooked chicken"" there is a drop down list where you can specify the type of serving or unit (so instead of saying 1 serving, you can choose grams or ounces etc.  I use grams so I can enter 83 grams of cooked chicken and it figures everything else out.  I tried putting in the rice I eat and I ended up making 1 serving = 1 gram.  So if I have 92 grams of cooked rice it says 92 servings.  

All that said I didn't have to put in many things, the rice for instance, there was already something that I could have used.

"
Thanks! So far I am not eating back my exercise calories. I checked sail rabbit and it comes really close to lose it ~100 calories. I’ll test it for a couple of weeks and see how it goes. 
Today I finally stepped again on the scale and I lost 4.5 lbs in one week. I’ll stick to lose it. It seems to work so far.
"Awesome!! Makes sense, thank you :) 

Can I skip the measuring and just weight the entire recipe after cooking, then weigh each portion I eat? I think cronometer will do the math for me… 

Also congrats on making it to the maintaining phase!!"
"Yepp! I use lose it too! So if you are at 0 for the week you are still at the deficit for the 1.5lbs. I sometimes ‘collect’ a bit more of a deficit during the week so I can use it on the weekend if I have something on and still be in a deficit.

Main thing to remember is even if you go a little bit over, don’t punish yourself, you are in a large deficit so even if you go a little over, you are still in a overall deficit and will lose weight. Just stick to it and it’ll happen!"
cronometer for sure. best macro and nutrient tracking out there.
Cronometer. All food entries are reviewed or come from government databases. I’ve found other apps like loseit to be wildly inaccurate and unreliable.
"Tbh tracking Indian food is a bit hard since everyone makes the dishes differently - I'm guju but I put way less sugar in my dal than many of my friends who are guju

I typically like to use cronometer and create personal recipes in there for tracking kcals"
"I like **cronometer**, the free options are great and nothing necessary is behind a paywall. A lot of people use **lose it**, I use lose it whenever I don't have Internet for an extended period of time because it has a pretty good offline database. I prefer to use cronometer because I feel like it has a lot of free options that lose it makes you pay for."
"I really like mynetdiary, but I don't like how they calculate how many calories you need to lose x pounds per week.  I use cronometer to calculate my calories and enter that number into mynetdiary

I think it's my favorite calorie counting app I've ever used, even compared to lose it before they made their barcode scanner premium"
"The short version is that they use a different equation than the tdee calculator that this sub recommends.  I like to use the sedentary option for my tdee at maintenance, and for the cico sub determination, that comes out to 2405, but mynetdiary's comes out to 2901.  It's a huge difference, and I maintain at 2405 and gain very quickly at 2900"
My barcode scanner on my net diary along with my food scale makes it SO easy. Not sure I could do it without
same. just switched to macrofactor last week and it’s superior to myfitnesspal. love it.
"Just started using lose it, and it seems pretty good, but I've been using my macros + for years and it's great."
I use lose it and just search for the item by name. they are usually in there and you don't have to use the barcode.
"Bar code scans have been off. It happens too frequently for me to see the barcode element as a ""feature"".

I take a picture of food item or ingredient on a scale and end up at the end of the day. I also pre- plan my meals by 1-4 weeks. I source my calorie info from current packaging or looking up the food item via google USDA's info. 

If I forget to take a picture I just write down what it was and the grams in my notepad app.

I only use the apps if I am reviewing my macros or building a new meal/recipe or dish anymore. I use MyFitnessPal but always find errors in food. I keep meaning to download cronometer or loseit and replace myfitnesspal but just havent. 

Sitting down once a month and preplanning meals made me really not give a floop about apps. It is good as a learning tool, but not really needed for the long run once you get your new habits sorted."
"I bought a lifetime to lose it which is basically free if you use it for the next 40 years but yeah chronometer is the only one left with barcode scanning free, and I suspect even they will fall soon"
"I use Cronometer, the free version has everything you need to get you started and it's very user friendly. Every food in their database is correct as everything on there is pre approved as opposed to myfitnesspal for example where you will find a million entries for the same food by different users, often wrong so you need to double check everything."
"I’ve been using [lose it!](https://www.loseit.com/) for 10 years
It give you a daily limit, based on your info and how much weight you want to lose in a week 0.5-2lbs 
In the 10 years I’ve only used the free version."
"I'm using fatsecret. Pretty barebones but thanks to that it's simple to use. I add recipes and add the finished weight for portions so it's easy to log. 

But it usually takes some time because it's probably US based so products and brands are different so you have to change measurements to hit the same calories."
"Yes, you can track all macros for free on lose it.

You can track daily protein, carbs and fats, swipe left on calorie tab 

You can also track all macros per meal if you click on the title of each meal, “breakfast” “lunch” and “dinner”… I think a lot of people don’t realize this, too."
"In my opinion, there isn't anything out there better than MacroFactor. Devs are active on reddit in r/macrofactor and there's regular updates and improvements to the app. It takes an adherence neutral approach and calculates your expenditure to an absurd level of accuracy. Largest RD verified database and stuff like AI describe where you literally talk your recipe to the app and it autocreates the recipe. You can also copy and paste recipes from the Internet into it as well. I've lost 15kg with it. Genuine game changer. Its paid but worth every since penny"
"Can't go past cronometer. Every item is staff screened, has an option for grams, and they have impressive vitamin and mineral tracking/breakdown."
"I like when the data is hidden away and I can get reports. Like, on cronometer it's easy to enter stuff, but I can tap through to see nutrient reports and breakdowns of them."
"Thanks a lot! I'm on week 2 of physiotherapy and beginning to start walking outside again! For what regards running doctors told me to wait a couple of months and do low impact exercises instead 💪🏽 
Gosh! I thought the link was the same as 2 weeks ago, this should work! https://to.yazio.com/pH951"
I paid for lose it premium for a year and switched back to MFP. Lose it is pretty but I just prefer MFP for some reason
"Yes, cronometer is orders of magnitude better. All the entries are correct, and they all offer grams.

Your TDEE is about  2500, so yeah, 2250 is a bit high. Did you tell it you were exercising? Your BMR is 2200 even if you are 18, so whatever you are entering into sites is wrong."
i also use loseit but the free version and can confirm the barcode scanner is free :)
"I am extremely happy with https://www.fatsecret.com/ for many years now. Nearly everything you need is free, just pre-made recipes, water tracking and meal plans and so on are behind a Premium subscription (you can of course still pre-log and make your own recipes and use user made recipes)."
"loseit! you log daily, but if you pull down the top bar you can see weekly!! it's nice if certain days are higher but you can still see you're under for the week! i love it"
"So I went through a phase about three months ago when my premium subscription of myfitnesspal expired where I tried all the main ones (lose it, cronometer, macrofactor, etc.).

I ultimately settled with lose it and purchased a lifetime sub for $60 after one month of their normal month to month subscription. Loseit has all the features you really need (scanner, macros, large food database) but the main reason I liked it is that it can scan labels and autofill nutrient information. It's been a lifesaver when a barcode doesn't come up with anything.

I will say though that I absolutely loved my one week trial of macrofactor and if only it was cheaper, I'd have subscribed."
"Google fit syncs with lose it. You can tell Google fit you started ""strength training"" and when to stop then lose it gives you how many calories it thinks you should burn strength training in an hour. Is it precise? No. If I wasn't losing weight despite a the app showing deficit I would probably stop counting exercise calories."
"i use my apple watch ultra 2 and lose it. lose it doesn't automatically give me every calorie the watch says i burned during an exercise back, it uses the total estimate of calories burned from the watch over the entire day.

two weeks ago i ate 1700 calories over maintenance, according to my tracking and what the apple watch said i burned (i didn't intentionally eat every single exercise calorie back, but i wasn't really trying all that hard to stay under my goal either). 1700 calories says i should have gained roughly 0.5 lb. my actual weight over those seven days went up 0.6 lb.

almost everyone in this sub continues to parrot the idea that all wearables are useless to all people on earth for tracking calories out...i'm here to say that's not necessarily the case. don't eat all of your exercise calories back all the time if you're trying to lose, but also eating some of them back isn't going to destroy all of your progress as some here would have you believe.

earlier today i had this argument with someone on this sub who said that if he ate his exercise calories back, he'd ""quickly be 400 lbs"" which is absurd, unless he's already 399 lbs."
"The loseit app allows you to take pictures of the barcode and the nutrition info, see if that helps you"
"I created a custom food in cronometer. I set it so 1 gram of ""manual entry"" equals 1 calorie. I use it for a couple of places that have nutrition info not in the app, but I don't feel like creating all the things individually. IIRC Myfitnesspal (and probably many of the others) also lets you create custom foods, so you could do the same."
"BTW The myfitnesspal app also lets you scan barcodes.

There's also an item named ""calorie"" in the food database that has 1 calorie.  So you can just add those if you don't want to track food.

And remember you should also track your water to make sure you're getting 8 cups per day!"
"I have used MFP, lose it, and chronometer.  I like MFP best.  The interface on the other two are definitely nicer, but MFP shows me more of what I want to see in a simple way.  

I liked how chronometer showed me more of my micronutrients but I really disliked my food not being separated out into meals.  The downside of it not having as many user entries for food was that it means some foods, like restaurant stuff, wasn't in there.  I know MFP user entries can be inaccurate but I've had no problems just searching for a food and choosing something in the mid-high average and going with that.  Still consistently losing weight even on weeks we do a lot of take out.

I tried lose it but was immediately turned off that I had to buy premium to connect to my fitness tracker.  It's free with other apps and I don't want to spend $30 just to get my exercise in there.  I'd rather pay for premium MFP to unlock some extra features if I'm going to spend money.  

Chronometer was overwhelming with all the different graphs and things.  I didn't find most of them terribly interesting or helpful for my fitness goals, so I just ignored them.

There was this really cool weekly report I've seen people post on here from lose it and I really wanted it, but apparently it depends on the version of the app you get based on your phone operating system and I can't get it on my phone.  MFP has a similar report (weekly calorie goal versus daily) so I get what I need anyway. 

After trying all the main apps I'm an MFP person."
"The simplest one is an excel sheet but it's not necessarily the simplest to use depending on how you like logging your meals.

Cronometer, loseit are both handy apps that work well. Someone mentioned Yaizo here a while back so you may give it a shot and see if ti works for you."
"I like loseit.  
I think it's cuter.  
Also it doesn't look HORRIBLE when you go over. That's something I hated about MFP- I felt like a horrible failure because the numbers were big and red haha It still gives you and estimate of when you will lose weight that will change as you stick to your calories or not overall rather than ""in five weeks"" idk I just kinda like it better. I tried it and stayed :)"
"MyFitnessPal ! Try different apps and suit yourself of course, but i like the professional design of mfp, i love the stats section, how good customer support is, but most importantly if you’re not from the US or europe other apps wont have the brands your country has, or i cant find traditional / ethnic dishes on loseit, there arent enough options. while in MFP you can find pretty much any food."
i dug around for macros tracking apps that don't show calories with no luck. i will try cronometer tho!
I prefer lose It over my fitness pal. I think the library is way larger and I like the extra things in the app mfp didn’t offer
I am so proud of you 🥹 i gained 40 pounds in 2 months in a depressed state and now that i am better ive been shedding the pounds with lose it as well!
It gets harder and harder as you have less to lose. I’m only trying to lose 20 lbs of regain and it’s slow going at 1200 cals on Saxenda. When I had 100 to lose it flew off.
"I prefer lose it over my fitness pal. I can see overall weekly trends and it helps me track calories over the week rather than just daily. So if I go over on one day, I can see how much I’ve been under that week and it always reassures me. I’ve never had any issues finding any UK food on it. 

Good luck!"
"well myfitnesspal is the most common free calorie and macro tracking app for sure...its pretty easy to use but could most certainly be better for the amount of users it has. 

if anyone has any better suggestions feel free to drop em"
"the only truly free app i know is called waistline. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waist.line&gl=US&pli=1

it is fully opensource, they will never ask for any kind of money. the other apps can remove wihout much warning features you like behind a paywall. 

you can get your own usda api and enter it on the app and has bar scanner etc. 

the other 'free' version, loseit, chronometer, etc make a commodity out of you, you don't mind watching ads, ok fair, but they are making money on you. they are not privacy friendly. 

you may say you don't have anything to hide? do you close your curtains when you change clothes or lock your door when you go out?"
My understanding is that WW has a lot of zero point foods and they expect you to fill your day with those. I use the lose it app and it’s worked well for me since CICO makes sense to me and it is something I should be able to sustain without the app. A housemate has been using WW and we had a moment where we both went to log a small hostess dessert item which was only 160 calories but 9 points on their app. It works for some people but that level of restriction (with the bad foods vs good foods) doesn’t work for me. Good luck with finding what works best for you!
"It is nice and simple but missing a few things that I use all the time on loseit.


1.  Recipes - I eat the same homemade things alot and not being able to create recipes makes that more work to log.


2.  How quantities are added.   Now, when you hit the plus button a food is added by serving.   To edit the amount I need to select the food from the log, edit it and then I can only edit the serving portion.   I would just like to be able to enter grams and have it happen in the process of adding the food, not after the fact."
Great work guys! Sadly this comes like 3 weeks after I paid for a lifetime to lose it lmao but this is awesome for anyone not wanting to spend
"I know it costs an arm and a leg for access to the nutrition label library. Do you have access to the same thing MFP, Carbon, loseit are using or is your info coming from elsewhere?"
"Just randomly found this app after googling to see if MFP and lose it still have the barcode scanner behind a paywall. I am super happy with it so far, thank you for your hard work!! ❤️"
"we currently only use fatsecret API, but we plan to expand.

and my roommate is working on micronutrient previews right now! we will add micro goals in the next update if we can’t do it in this one, but at the very least you will be able to see the micronutrients for each food"
"I prefer cronometer. I tried my fitness pal and lose it but I just didn't find them as straightforward as cronometer is and you can scan barcodes and see micro/macro nutrient %'s without needing to pay extra. 

I also didn't like, can't remember which one it was, that one of them was flagging things as good or bad towards my deficit. But it would kick out random info that wasn't helpful but just fit the algorithm it was running on."
I started w MfP and just became a habit. I tried switching but found MFP had a bigger database so it saved me time from entering stuff in. I like mynetdiary bc of ux is nicer and it’s easier to input per gram sometimes but they don’t have a huge database. And someone here promoted their app fitbee but again the database is what kept me on MFP.
I’ve always used mfp like on and off since 2012. UK seems to get the barcode reader for free and the database is good for the foods I want and all my recipes.
"It’s advertising. And also unwillingness to change.
I use MFP and I love it.
I have seen enough in this subreddit to know lose it is probably a little bit better.
But I have made great progress while using MFP.
I have already downloaded it, Given them my card details and input meal info, so changing would be a hassle.
MFP pays a lot of money for advertising and as a result is usually the first to mind that people come across, so they download and stick with it. 
It’s the same as banks and lots of other businesses. People are lazy (hence why we need to lose weight!!) 
Use whatever works !"
I use cronometer.  I like seeing micro & macro nutrients
"My fitness pal was the OG. When calorie counting first became popularized (instead of things like gluten free, low fat, paleo etc) that was the only one out there that had your basic food dairy, meal entry, and barcode scanner. It was on your phone and easy to do.

I didn’t calorie count again for years but when I picked it back up again, I tried lose it based off a video I had seen on tiktok. It’s much easier to use, and the free version has pretty much all you need!"
"I have tried several apps. Off the top of my head:


* Lose It


* Fitbit (I think)


* Chronometer


* MyFitnessPal


* Macrofactor (currently using this)


* Probably more, been tracking for a while




Lose It


I didn't like lose it because the ads felt obnoxious and I didn't like that it would show red when I ate over my daily calorie limit and I believe it would show weekly calories and that was getting me in the habit of trying to ""make up"" for eating over my calories one day by eating less the next. Also, I found a large number of really incorrect entries when I used it.


Note: I use Lose It a *loooong*  time ago.


Fitbit


I *hated* that it would automatically add back calories based on what it thought I burned. My calories burned was always wrong. And I do not believe that you could turn off that feature at the time.


Chronometer


Honestly don't exactly remember why I didn't like that one but I believe that I just didn't feel like the UI was intuitive to me. It looked fine, I just didn't like clicking through do do what I needed.




MyFitnessPal


I literally only stopped using it because they put the barcode scanner behind a paywall and I figured if I was going to pay for a product, I would pay for a better one.




Macrofactor (what I currently use)


UI is intuitive, has a barcode scanner, no screaming Yay or anything at me. I just want something to hold my numbers and be fast and easy to use. It does have the feature of adjusting calories based on how much weight you are losing (or gaining if that is your goal). I just don't need that feature because I do the math on paper and am always within 100 calories of what it calculated any way. But it can be handy for someone who does not want to do that math."
"I just stumbled upon Calory and I really like it over MFP, lose it etc… for the simple reason that it is soooo streamlined. Sleek, no fuss, modern app. The one thing I could never stand was all the extra “stuff”. Tracking alone was enough to hurt my brain, I didn’t need the visual clutter 😵‍💫"
I prefer macrofactor
Tbh I think macrofactor is best. I stopped using MFP when the barcode scanner became premium.
"Lose it is by far better. I frequently look at Reddit before I buy things in order to get a more realistic idea about things. Not to say there isn’t some hidden marketing dressed up as organic posts.

The problem with a lot of websites and blogs is that they’re essentially designed to create a passive income , which means that those top ten lists (especially around xmas time ) are very much affiliate websites. The site gets paid for you clicking the link. 

I expect that mfp pay better per click"
I LOVE the Lose It app.  My friend was using both MFP and Lose it at the same time to see which one she liked better and she also ended up settling on lose it.  She was using the paid versions of both.
"I love cronometer. Especially in love lately with the ""add recipe"" button bc I can just scan all the items in and set a serving size and It'll do all the heavy lifting calculations for me."
I love it so much it’s SO useful for macros. The free version is on par with the paid version of mfp
"(This answer is a bit rambly sorry!)

Haha, I do get what they're aiming for with trying to highlight patterns that help individuals succeed at weight loss etc but it just made me dislike the app. 


I think its because I don't want an app telling me or even ""gently implying"" what I should and shouldn't eat to lose weight, all I want is an app to track what I eat so I can stay below maintenance overall and lose weight ha. 


So I'm sure for some people that would be a wonderful feature and I hope it works well for you :). 


I downloaded all three (mfp, lose it and cronometer) and was going to log in all of them simultaneously for a few days but after the first day I realised which one worked for me. 


They are all surprisingly different from each other, I didn't think a tracking app could be that varied but clearly was wrong ha"
"I'm in the UK :). For anything it doesn't know I just scan it and either take a photo of the nutrition label and it auto enters the numbers it reads or I just add it myself. Most of the stuff I have is on there now. It has a surprising amount of UK stuff, e.g from the supermarkets here so it's a shame it sounds like it's not been populated much with entries from other parts of Europe. 


The only stuff it tends to not recognise are things that are random allergy friendly foods that I buy. But once I've entered them it remembers them fine :). 

For the meat etc I just double checked the numbers on the food packaging and found an entry that matched the per 100g amount on the packs I buy or at least one that was close enough and then reuse that saved entry for that item each time I have it. 

I hope you find one that does work for you and fingers crossed cronometer gets more data that is useful to you :)."
I have had premium since 2010!  I seem to lose it and then gain 1/4-1/2 of it back and get back on track.
"Same here, I also got lifetime for $50. I had to wait about 8 months into my first year of $19.99 premium. There were other sales before and may have been down to $50 but I think it was my third “lifetime sale” promotion that it was $50. 

I used my fitness pal and lose it concurrently for a year (free vs free) before I bought my yearly on lose it. I had previously used my fitness pal for 5-6 years until they pulled the free barcode scanner."
"I like the free version of [FatSecret.](https://fatsecret.com/) Visually, it is clean with no pop-ups, ads, or pitches to upgrade to paid. The app interface works better for me than Chronometer or LoseIt. 


 The free version  has  bar code scanning, daily and weekly summaries of 14 macros/nutrients,  ability to pre-plan days, save meals, track weight, etc. I'm told it has a good international database of foods. [It's the API behind Amazon, FitBit, Lifescan, Samsung, etc.](https://platform.fatsecret.com/api/)"
"
YES

The free reports feature in mine gives daily, week to date, and weekly totals. You can also set **different targets for different  days.**


It is the free version of [FatSecret.](https://fatsecret.com/) Visually, it is clean with no pop-ups, ads, or pitches to upgrade to paid.

Again if someone has the ability to send someone the foods and weigh the portions I think they have jumped the hurdle of not finding time to log food. Idk it just doesn't make a lot of sense to me. If I was going to send another party my food details and then wait for the calorie info to come back I could just go onto mfp or whatever and log it ?
i ate 1400 calories worth of muffins yesterday (12 muffins)... still in a weekly deficit and im trying to maintain weight not lose it so whatever but not exactly my proudest moment lol
"When I started I loosely estimated and logged on lose it app. Ie, half a banana, 1/2 cup rice. Over time after it became habit to log I wanted accuracy so I started weighing everything. Even if you’re in a foreign country, lose it allows you to pick a region and scan barcodes if you can’t read the product due to language barrier. For other things, rice is rice, chicken is chicken, invest in a small kitchen scale just weigh them out."
"i personally count it. my maintenance is on the low side due to my height so if i didn’t add my exercise calories i’d be eating under 1000 to lose the weight i want to lose. what i’ve been doing is finding my sedentary TDEE (1573 for me rn) and i use a METS calculator to determine the calories i burn in my moderate intensity elliptical workout, which is usually around 300. so therefore my TDEE is 1873 and i subtract 500 from that. 

i know people can run into problems with eating back exercise calories, but if u use some trail and error and REALLY research how many calories ur truly burning during exercise, you can get the math pretty close. i’ve been losing perfectly on track for 2 months doing this. make sure u adjust the numbers as ur weight falls though. 

and be careful not to double count your exercise calories, i did that at first lol

edit: oh and don’t log ur exercise calories in lose it! i use that app too and that’s exactly how i screwed up the first time. just do the math yourself and find the budget they give you that’s closest to that. for example lose it says my daily budget is 1350 to lose 1lb a week as someone lightly active; if i were to then log my exercise calories on TOP of that, i’d be double counting because the original budget already accounted for that activity. in that case i’d be eating 1650 and only in a 200 calorie deficit for the day, instead of 500."
Me too :) it’s made this much easier. Also wanted to add to your original point - loseit has an awesome barcode scanner and I’ve noticed no inconsistency in 3 weeks of using it. Fitbit was wildly inaccurate. MFP wasn’t great either.
Bar code scanner is free on mfp.
"Hey!  First of all, good on you, man!  Good luck with developing your strats.  Proud of you!

I don't know if I have any real magic bullets.  Here's what I've got...

I'm doing intermittent fasting at the same time (using the Zero app). That's been really helpful to develop the routine. It's tough in the beginning but I can get by with a cup of coffee in the AM without breaking the fast and then I'm down to really just two meals to deal with. Takes a little time to get used to, but that's worked for me.

And I'm logging the meals into my calorie counting app (myfitnesspal) before I start eating. If I wait until after the meal, it's more likely I'd forget.

Take care, homie!"
"I'm using the Lose It app https://www.loseit.com/ since MFP really has fallen out of favor with too many ads, too high of a cost, and no free barcode scanner in the USA anymore.

^^8 ^^yrs. ^^maintaining ^^• ^^♂60 ^^5'11^^/179㎝ ^^SW:298℔^^/135㎏ ^^CW:171℔^^/78㎏  ^^[\[3Y&nbsp;AMA\]](https://redd.it/6m6vxq), ^^[\[1Y&nbsp;recap\]](http://redd.it/3cqszm) ^^CICO+🚶🏋️"
"I use lose it for both calorie and exercise. I have apple watch which interfaces with my phone so I can see the calories and the steps and exercise go into the app. i usually don't do the calorie discount for exercise and I set my budget for the maintenance calorie budget for my goal weight minus 500 calories. I try to keep my actual intake 150 below that because I'm post menopause. 

The issue with weight watchers is that they take two discounts. They take a discount for fiber ( gms fiberX4 subtract from the total daily calorie intake) and they also discount for exercise. 300 cal/40 minutes more or less. I think it's too many discounts for someone who is within 50lbs of their goal weight. I also think the way they do the discounts encourages low protein intake which stalls weight loss, or it does for me. They incorporate this into.the point system but it's not hard to figure out the math. I think the carb intake is too high if you work that way and that causes problems with blood sugar spikes. This in turn causes increased insulin production and fat storage to some degree. ( you both burn and store according to insulin levels) Weight watchers can work okay if you drop the points lower and increase protein to an appropriate level. Carbs should be from low sugar vegetables and low sugar fruit."
There are a few apps I use a lot. [Lose It](https://www.loseit.com) for tracking macros and calories. Worth waiting for an offer on getting the premium version (goes on offer all the time). [Strong](https://www.strong.app) is great for tracking your workout stats (for weightlifting specifically) and can help make sure you are progressing with time. [Fitness Calculator](https://fitnesscalculator.app) for checking my BMI and working out a rough TDEE.
"I use cronometer and map my walk for tracking dog walks since I’m in a walking challenge for June. Would like to add something to track workouts (aqua fitness, weight training) since cronometer isn’t great for that. Here for any suggestions!"
LoseIt paid app. Also tried carbon and it’s cool but I like lose it better
"Yeah, Sounds good in general. Although you need premium to make the app good at least that what people claim. For now I go for the other recommendation since it looked like it does everything I need for free. If I ever get unhappy with the app or I don't see any improvement I will go for the premium version of loseit since so many people seem to be happy with the app. But for now ill give the other app a shot first."
Yayayayayayayay! Congrats!! I'm on day 80! I also use lose it! DM me if you'd like to be friends on there!
I used an online TDEE calorie to work out maintenance per day then -500 for calorie deficit. Use a tracking app like lifesum to record absolutely everything you eat or drink.
"I use [myfitnesspal.com](https://myfitnesspal.com)  

It has a web version and a phone app version - and both 'learn' what you regularly eat or drink (and prompt you)

The phone app has a built-in barcode reader.  

It also has the ability (when you enter a regular item) to say 'this food is often eaten at the same time'  


https://imgur.com/a/M9aK3jT"
"I asked exactly this question on r/loseit last weekend. Someone said eat 50% back, some said they ate all their calories back, as ultimately they were still in a deficit on the plan they were doing. 

If it’s a “minimal exercise” day I don’t eat them back. 

If I’ve done a run over 7 miles I eat half back. 

This weekend I’m doing a 30 mile hill run and damn sure I’m eating half of those calories back!"
"I use mfp. I have the app and have my profile open on my computer. 

I always track it right after I eat. And I always know where I am at for macros throughout the day. 

I then start to eat more and more of the same things as my staples. It makes it way easier to be consistent."
"I use the free version of the lose it app. It's pretty simple. You have to say no to the full version when you fire it up and there's an ad every once in a while. I use it like a simple list, the hardest part is picking  up my phone and actually logging in the entries. I lost like 40 lbs , gained back 12 when I stopped logging in my food and am starting over"
"I use the lose it app. 

When I'm busy, I eat a lot of the same things and the app remembers what I ate the day before so its easy to click it in. I do this a lot for lunch when I'm at work. 

It used to have a free bar code scanner but now its only for premium users. However, they have premium on sale a lot. so you can log stuff until it eventually goes on sale again. 

Weigh everything! I have a food scale in the kitchen and I weigh everything I eat. 

I always log BEFORE I eat so I don't forget to do it. Also so I can remove things from my plate if I need to. Sometimes I do this so I have calories available for dessert. lol 

It takes practice. I've fallen off the wagon many times. This time I'm doing really well. I have to remember that I may gain weight again but I know I can lose it again. Good luck. If you have questions, feel free to message me or respond to this comment."
I think you need to have the paid membership with lose it to see the combined total.. that was my understanding anyway. I'm usually wrong though haha good luck!
"Always after everything’s cooked! Like i said, my dad cooks the indian dishes, and it’s not like i’m going to interfere when he’s trying to cook by weighing out every ingredient (i’d look like a psychopath). I measure it when it’s cooked, and look at the range of calories on myfitnesspal! Done this for 2 years and it never failed me - lost 40 lbs and maintained it since :) i eat all the curry and naan and am considered skinny!

This is honestly the most simple way to go. You can’t “ask the person cooking to give u the details” as some would suggest. That sounds crazy and is not necessary!"
If you are looking for a recommendation I have been using Happy Scale for weight tracking the past year and been satisfied. I used lose it for calorie tracking.
"What you need (to know):

0) Start NOW doing something. Maybe just tracking what you eat (I use Cronometer) or walking some. Don’t wait until you have the perfect plan to start! 

1) patience. You didn’t gain weight overnight and won’t lose it overnight.

2) calorie counting (in and out) works. Food scale that weighs in grams is one of the most helpful tools. 

3) feedback loop is VERY important. Track what you do and watch your change in weight. If it’s not changing as you thought it would, you’re missing something - probably under measuring calories consumed and/or over measuring calories burned, so adjust some things and monitor. 

4) Don’t follow people that give you 20 things that cause it to work or not to work. Net calorie deficit is 95% of the battle. Also don’t follow people that promote tons of products. 

5) Weigh yourself as frequently as you feel comfortable. Daily is best but do weekly if daily causes too much stress. Also, use an ap like Happy Scale to provide a moving average for your weight. Your average weight over a week is more telling than your weight for a single day. 

6) don’t stress over macros. Get going with losing weight and then learn about macros and increasing protein. Net calories affect your weight. Protein and resistance training affect your body composition. 

7) carbs don’t cause you to gain weight. Eating too much with too little exercise does.

8) I listen to podcasts that keep me in the weight loss mindset. There are tons of them, but some of my favorites are:

We Only Look Thin

Food, We Need to Talk

Docs who Lift

Nutrition Diva

The Consistency Project

9) YOU CAN DO THIS! GOOD LUCK!

Edit: spelling"
"Check out the quick start guide from r/loseit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick\_start\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick_start_guide/) 

Their wiki is also super comprehensive and contains lots of useful information.

And I would definitely recommend getting a food scale!"
"Heres my over the top stack of gadgets and apps which are weight loss related.

Gadgets/physical products

- Oura ring for sleep tracking (getting 8 hours is core to making weight loss easy)
- Apple watch for activity tracking (I prefer to calculate TDEE by adding my BMR to active energy rather than using online estimates, I believe it to be more accurate)
- Espresso machine (weight loss booster, replaces snack cravings, however does cause addiction)
- Plenty of fitness apparel. Enough so that I can workout 5 days per week without worrying about having enough clean clothes.
-Physical scales for daily weigh-ins.
-Food scale for weighing food.

Apps:

- Weight diary for tracking weight
- Myplate for calorie counting (as good as loseit, mfp, etc im sure)
- Freeletics for HIIT workouts
- Insight timer for its timer (use it for stretching after workouts)
- Oura app

All of these feed into the Health app on iPhone, making a very streamlined experience."
I just moved from mfp to lose it and paid for its. It’s much more engaging and encouraging! It tracks trends and patterns. I am obsessed in a good way.

"I'm 47, 5'8"" and similar in activity to you. I maintain at 1950. I've been using an ap called macrofactor for the last couple of months, tracking religiously. It's really good for determining your actual output. When I go down to 1600 I lose slowly but consistently."
"I am currently using MyFitnessPal. Have you used both? Is macrofactor better? 

I’m realizing that 1,900 is pretty much around my maintenance calories. I’m adjusting to lower gradually."
"I have used both, I had years of data in MFP. Macrofactor is light years better. It's akin to using a calculator or doing math by hand in my opinion. I pay for macrofactor and it's so worth it."
"I absolutely cannot recommend MacroFactor enough, if you are a diligent person and can track all your food each day. 

It’s built on a very smart AI algorithm where if you weigh yourself regularly and input all the food you eat as accurately as possible, it tracks, estimates and predicts your TDEE, how much to eat or cut to lose or gain a specific amount of weight by a specific time. It can also keep you in maintenance. It also balances out the ups and downs in your weight fluctuations and uses the algorithm to give you an accurate weight estimate vs just what you see when you step on the scale.

After a couple weeks the algorithm is basically flawless. It’s like having a personalized nutrition coach. Lane Norton is associated with a similar app called “Carbon” but I have not used it before.  I lost 10-15 lbs during a mini cut last fall and had never cut before, and it was a great experience.

https://macrofactorapp.com/macrofactor/"
"Hi, no going over 460 calories one day is nothing.  I understand how you feel because I can be the same way when I’m calorie counting.  There have been days when I have eat over 1000+ calories. 

Even at this amount, it will mostly be water weight. 

This post has helped calmed my anxiety over the weight gain https://reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/zggqt2/_/izguxjj/?context=1


Basically you only gain weight when you make a habit of over eating constantly.  A pound of fat is 3500 calories so unless you’re consuming this amount consistently then try not to worry too much about it 😃"
Almost never weigh it but everything gets logged into macrofactor.
"I bought a paid subscription to lose it when it was on sale, I like it. If you like the social aspect it’s much more active on mfp though."
"I would highly recommend [MacroFactor](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/macrofactor/) for this.

It's a subscription service (as with most apps), but it does track micronutrients no problem and provides you with unlimited recipes as well. Their database is very nice and weeds out the fake entries, which is a huge problem with MyFitnessPal.

The nice thing about it is that it calculates your TDEE as you go along. Since your weight is largely a function of how much you're taking in vs. how much you're burning, their algorithms will calculate the latter if you provide it with your weight and calorie intake for the day. Very helpful for dieting purposes.

>I'd love an app that supports healthy eating, however I'm aware of the fact that this will limit my choices even more. I love the veggie and fruit tracker Lifesum has. I hate Yazio's use of colour - if I eat 400 calories below my target, I get rewarded with a ""green"" day, if I eat even one calorie more than my target, my day turns ""red"" as a punishment - I don't really like the message behind that.

Based on this, then I think MacroFactor is certainly the correct app for you. The best thing I've found about it is that it doesn't give you negative feedback in any way whatsoever. Nothing turns red or anything if you happened to overeat your calories for the day or went beyond your carbs or fats; it's 100% compliance neutral. You don't even have to follow their recommendations if you don't want to.

But yeah, it's definitely not a one-time payment. There are less and less apps that offer premium features for a one-time payment. However, the team behind the app is very responsive and absolutely committed to making the best diet app possible."
"Myfitnesspal! I tried cronometer but the first barcode I scanned ""couldnt be found in the system"".. it was a fairly popular product, so if the app doesnt even recognize that.. instant deleted it, lol"
">So I tried not active and looking at 2lbs to lose a week… it gives me a budget of 800cal a day.

>Folks… that’s an eating disorder. I may just put in a negative review about that to prevent other people from seeing that kind of stuff on this app. I spent money on this app too, so I would like to not switch to something else.

You would almost certainly have had to have clicked through a warning that said this was too low. Some apps expressly set the floor at 1200; Lose It does not.

>Calculating my TDEE with light exercise gives me 2,146cal a day for maintenance, and around 1,800 for an office job lifestyle. I’m somewhat in between that, so I think 1600 a day should be okay for losing weight.

I'm not entirely sure that Lightly Active is an appropriate setting for you.

>I’m worried about it not being enough to satisfy my hunger at nights, or limiting my stress about food.

I plan and track my meals for the day the night before as much as possible; that day, I open up the app and follow that plan. This allows me to feel satiated throughout the day (some hunger between meals is normal) while also planning in the occasional item that is relatively high in calories and low in nutrients. 

>But lately, I’ve been absolutely EXHAUSTED. Couldn’t bring myself to do exercises some days, crying over weighing food and it not being enough, stressing about planning for meals when both my BF and I are burnt out from our jobs, and also dealing with some mental health stuff.

>So, I took to r/loseit for advice on how to manage my stress during this time. Biggest advice I got: SLOW DOWN! Take a break, raise calories up a bit, let myself take the stress down before continuing on, and re-evaluating my goal with both GW at date together.

>I made that post a few days ago at around 179lbs.

>the first day into it, I weighed 178. Thought this was weird since I put more food in my body. So I got new batteries, saw it was 180-ish at the end of the day, and felt that was accurate. Then it went up to 181 today.

So you haven't actually taken that break that was suggested on Lose It. You increased your calories a little bit for a few days, but you haven't actually taken a break.

Take. A. Break. See https://bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/the-full-diet-break"
"I use mynetdiary. All of the logging / weight tracking is free currently, but there is a subscription option for things like autopilot calories and recipe saving."
"FatSecret still has a free scanner. I ran FatSecret and cronometer simultaneously for a week or so, and I landed on FatSecret for myself. I miss the old mfp before shareholder and corporate greed took over."
I love cronometer.  I use the paid version but used the free for a while before I upgraded.  I love that they use the NCCDB calorie counts and doesn't rely on some people's custom counts.  I've literally seen a bacon guacamole burger from Red Robin listed as 400kcals on MFP and it was someone's custom entry.  That doesn't happen on Cronometer that I've seen.
"I’ve been in this sub for years and this post made me realize it’s not a sub for people who use the lose it app 

I use the lose it app, it’s not the best but it’s easy to use and I lost 90 pounds with it. I’ve used it on and off for 10 years and have never paid a dime. I always eat back my calories from exercise. It’s my little “reward” for exercising that day. The lose it app automatically loads my exercise calories from my Apple Watch."
"Chronometer completely redid the front-end of their website and app and it is so much better than it was previously IMO. That being said, I paid for lifetime loseit premium and like it a lot as well."
"If you aren't paying for it, either you are the product, or they are trying to drive you to pay for it.  Meaning they will withhold features to the paid tier, and the paid tiers will actually be subsidizing the free users.  MFP is expensive because the paid users have to support all the free users + be profitable.

I found lose it premium to be worth it for the price, affordable and good for what you get. I use MacroFactor now, which has a fair price and no free tier, so they develop the app to be the best for everyone that uses it."
I use myfitnesspal but switched the region to United Kingdom and that made the scanner free again.
"I don’t know if I’m losing my mind but I can’t find it in my App Store

Edit: just kidding! It’s called calorie counter by cronometer! Thank you for this, I’ve been hoping to find a new one since my fitness pal took away the barcode scanner as a free option"
"Do not bring political topics or discussion into /r/loseit 

Stay on topic of OPs weight journey, the pictures, or the original poster's comments. Keep political debate to other subreddits regardless of your intention. Do not derail conversation."
"Hold on wait a minute, are you telling me this subreddit isn't named after the loseit app? I've been on here close to 2 years under the assumption it was for users of that app. I guess the more you know lol"
"I've been using cronometer for years and love it. 

But I had a playstore gift card at the time I got it and got a paid version so I don't know if the scanning feature is available in the free version. You could give it a try!"
"I have loseit premium and it's fine. I'm trying macrofactor at the moment but that's only available as a paid app.

Not sure if I will stick with it.

I did like MFP recipe feature and miss that 

But with Lose It I would just say watch the setting with the fitbit info. There is a feature that feeds over your activity so you ""earn"" more calories and I did not realize it at first and had to turn it off as it was throwing off my tracking. Of course some people may like to see that."
"I like macrofactor, although it is a paid app"
"I moved to loseit rightt after the announcement they were charging for barcodes and I find it much better to use. I like the UI more as well as the search, and the barcode scanner felt quicker."
I've used the paid version of loseit for my whole weight loss journey and I would recommend it.
I got lose it and paid for a year of premium for $20. Just from this thread alone it seems like lots of people have done the same!
"Chronometer has been WONDERFUL. They make it easy to use and add new foods if they aren't there plus they have barcode scanning.

My two problems are that you can't group food items into meals and you cannot import recipes from the Internet, meaning you have to input each item individually, both items are behind a paywall. It's working well enough without them for me. If I want to pay it's also cheaper for a lifetime subscription than mfp"
I’ve used lose it for years and like it a lot better than mfp.  The scanner is free btw.
"I can't use the Fitbit one, I legit do not understand how it works, it doesn't just give you an amount to eat, like hi please don't tell me I'm 300kcal over limit cause I had Weetabix wtf? Don't get it, don't understand how other people manage it, I tried loseit but it doesn't have a good EU database so the barcode is useless, tried two others, one I immediately yeetem on principle because it told me to eat 1000 kcal a day to lose 1lb a week (hi that's below min and also my TDEE is 1800+ normally), the other one I tried was ok but by the time I had been through them all I was so frustrated I deleted all three and went back to mfp 🙃"
"I have just started my journey and my fitness pal is really working for me. I looked at lose it and did not like it, too many options and pay wall also. 

I am just scared it will make me lose my streak so I just bought a one year prenium for 114$ cad. It is like 10$ a month so I just cancelled crave instead and actually saved 10 $ in subscriptions haha. 

I also use the recipe fonction a loooot and I did not wanna lose all my custom recipes that are already on there.

I think it will also hold me accoundable to use it for one year, which is the expected time of my loss journey. I will probably look into something else for maintenance after that. I think it is worth it if you don't like change like I do ( neurodivergent)."
Yazio cuz its half as popular as mfp so I can easily find products by scanning. Plus it looks pretty & has the carbs protein and fats on the main page
I've used every calorie tracker. Been using lose it for 3 years. It's fantastic. Never found another one that competes. Chronometer is close but has a limited catalog of foods. However it does track every micronutrient which is awesome
I'll carry on with mfp I didn't really use the scanner
"I never used MFP (beyond downloading and trying it out) for a lot of reasons, but I'm using cronometer and love it. It does have 5 second adds (skip then) sometimes but it's not too bad. It tracks micronutrients which has helped me figure out what foods to eat to get most of the way there and what vitamin pills I should be taking (which right now is half a multivitamin + a vitamin D pill)."
"I have used Lose it for YEARS. i actually had to download mfp for a project once and felt like it wasn’t as accurate in adding your exercises. I have lose it premium and I think it’s super worth it. It’s very easy to use for a tech dummy like me. I like to track my calories, macros, sodium, cholesterol, water intake, exercise and steps. But they have way more like you can track your sleep and every other nutrient I’m pretty sure as well. There’s a place to put weight and progress pics as well I’m pretty sure. Great app"
For me a bunch of the loseit numbers were just straight up incorrect. I was eating vastly more than I should have. The calories are more accurate on chronometer so far
I used the loseit app like 4 years ago and switched to MFP solely because it was more accurate and had better features. Now that everyone seems to prefer it I think I’m going to switch back and try it out again.
"The functions weren't the same, I tried Lose it for example  and paid for premium and I can't remember everything but I just love how easy it is to copy the meal from today to tomorrow on mfp, and to make recipes and to eat like 1/10th of it etc.

I asked for my money back from Google play store n got it back."
"This is why I stopped using MFP. Garbage data everywhere. Or the lazy shits only enter the calories but not any of the macros, or only one of the macros. Plus there was not way to flag entries as inaccurate or accurate. Plus weird serving sizes on stuff. I have a food scale. I want to be able to do everything in grams, but nooooo, tablespoons or other odd things.

Use www.cronometer.com. Not as many entries but they are from databases not crowd sourced by lazy people. You can always add your own custom entries easily."
"This is one reason why I use Cronometer instead. They review anything that is accepted into their database, and most data comes from reliable sources (USDA, the restaurants themselves, etc.). That means their database is limited, but drastically more accurate for what is there. If you eat a lot of simple whole foods (like, say, a piece of fruit) the experience of logging it is 10,000x less frustrating on cronometer. I end up entering custom foods a lot more, which is a pain, but worth it for the accuracy (and it's a much faster site). There are downsides but I find myself so much less annoyed than I did with MFP, all because of the crap people spewed into the MFP database."
"i’m sorry, i am a long time lurker to the “lose it” subreddit, so if what i am about to say warrants downvotes then so be it..

but to me, it seems counter intuitive that the general consensus in this post is that of “screw these apps/sites for posting wrong fast food data,” instead of “you shouldn’t be eating fast food to begin with if you’re trying to lose weight.”  

again, maybe i am wrong, or being offensive in saying that.. and if that’s the case, i honestly apologize.

it just seems to me that if the goal is to lose weight, eating healthier should be the goal, right..?  

It’s hard for me to understand putting more blame on an app for misrepresenting calories in a BK combo meal, than yourself for opting to eat at that BK regularly and expecting to lose weight..."
"Yes! I used to use the Livestrong calorie tracking app, called MyPlate, and it had verified listings that were accurate and came up first in search. I only switched to MFP because so many r/loseit challenge team members are on it. The only downside to MyPlate was that it didn’t have as many entries for restaurant food and such since it isn’t as popular these days as MFP and LoseIt, but it’s a much better experience. I had used MyPlate on and off starting around 10 years ago up until 1 year ago. 

Edit: the more I talk about MyPlate, the more I want to switch back and say goodbye to those obnoxious MFP ads. "
"I have no experience with making bread :( sorry. That said, lose it and mfp are very close. In lose it you can add foods super fast, perhaps that could be a solution."
"As a German living in the UK now, it took me ages to find a good English calorie counter with a good local data base. There is a very good German one (FDDB) with all the local products which is very accurate and even has pictures. After moving, I tried MFP, lifesum, etc... I was especially annoyed with MFP for the reasons you mentioned. 
I then found the NutraCheck calorie counter app. I love it and don’t even mind paying monthly. I find their food entries very accurate and they even have pictures of a lot of the foods and big brands here in the UK."
"I don’t think I ever said no foods are objectively unhealthy??? But the way that lifesum categories things is not a complete picture and uses a certain algorithm which prioritizes some characteristics over others, not in a way everyone would agree with. "
"Begin with the end in mind, because it answers these questions:

> what meals/food groups in general are best to stick to when in a calorie deficit and intermittent fasting! 

In the end, you'll be wanting to maintain your lost weight eating the foods you enjoy, socializing sometimes, occasional gatherings, holidays/travel, etc..   So temporary things we do are distractions, not helping us to learn to keep off the weight.   Don't eat weirdly to lose weight.  Eat as yourself, and shape your habits up.  Otherwise, we lose and regain in cycles.

> Are there any apps or websites that help calculate calories based on meals you type in, even if you don’t know the breakdown of each ingredient!

The sites MyFitnessPal and Nutritionix (which is a database used by Cronometer and others) have a lot of restaurant data.  The site allrecipies.com is very popular and most of their popular recipes are also entered.   This is helpful for restaurant food, even if it isn't the same restaurant.   

We may not be precise, but we can be generally fair and accurate that way.  If we're making fair guesses, about half will be too high and half too low, *so these errors will nullify each other* and leave us with sums that are very close to true.  This is the **[Law of Large Numbers](https://www.google.com/search?q=law+of+large+numbers)** and it works for us. 

Use the entry from another restaurant and call it good enough.  

Have a personal rule that you don't have to eat all of a meal that you didn't portion.  Restaurant portions are large, and very few restaurant meals are <600 Calories.    Often, we can eat half (for 600) and take half home and get another full meal out of that (for 600) -- 1200 to 1600 for some of these family restaurants is common -- but do itemize it. 

Chains over 20 restaurants in the USA disclose their calories on menus now.  If your Mom & Pop place doesn't, look for an entry for that menu item from a big chain -- it's probably going to be good enough.

Read this for the philosophy of it.  It's fine for Intermittent Fasting.  Usually IF is done without calorie counting but I too have done it with counting.

That's the method to start. Follow that guide and that timing, using your regular and normal food, and using portion control as your main tool for change.

"I use my fitness pal. Maybe explain what you dont like avout loose it / MFP since those two seems to be like bbe far the best. Maybe there is something you are using wrong or dont know about

I tried Noom but its so expensive (and i am paying for mfp). They also put my calories reslly high and I could not go lower and the calories they add after work out were really high (i love that my fitness pal barely add cals from working out)"
"I use loseit, got the lifetime in the most recent sale it pushed me for. Gotta occasionally screen foods for sense checks, barcodes are generally pretty accurate in calories. I'm not massively invested in my macros/micros but if I was I might have a different approach, they can be missing or wacky quite often due to the user-maintained submissions"
I use cronometer because it also tracks micronutrients for free
"another pro for MFP, i live in france and ive tried most of the popular android available trackers, every single one other than MFP took less than a day to delete because they have NO database for our food, i can scan pretty much anything in my kitchen rn on mfp and 9 times out of ten itll have the result, normally bang on accurate too, all the other apps just dont have them so you have to create a food for everything"
"Yes but also macros lol. I use cronometer, I love being like 'ooooh I could do with more iron tomorrow' when I'm planning my meals, and going on a wee detective hunt to find something suitable with iron 🤣"
"I used to hate doing it before, but once I started racking up a streak it became more fun.  Also, discovering that I like the mechanics for lose it more versus MFP helped."
"I paid £15.90 for a year - but previously I was using myfitnesspal which was £15.99 a month for less features. 

Tbh I think £15.90 a year for an app I use daily with no issues is a fair price! Definitely wouldn't pay more than that though."
"I ended up just buying the lifetime version. Idk that it’s necessary, but I don’t regret it. Using the loseit app has helped me drop 30 lbs and I’ll keep using it to maintain (at least for awhile) once I drop another 10, so I’m not super bothered by dropping the money on it. But really there’s no reason to unless you want to be able to log tomorrow’s food. I find it helpful, but you definitely don’t need it to succeed!"
I use my net diary app to scan barcodes and just guess the best I can. It's been working well so far and takes the stress out. You can build recipes and save favorite foods. Nothing has to be perfect if it works and you are allowed to change things until you find something that works that you don't hate.

"I’m a dad (26M) of 2 that works full-time and also has ADHD. I weighed 340+ at my heaviest and without counting calories i managed I get down to 295 in a year or so but it was mostly attributed to taking on a much more physically active job than anything. I was stuck in the 290s until my doctor told me to download mynetdiary and buy a food scale. 

It was a long 18 months of trial and error but I’m down to 240 and losing around 10 pounds a month now. From my experience it’s possible to lose weight without tracking calories but if you want to lose the weight and keep it off, Relearning how to eat and have a healthy relationship though tracking calories is the most important thing you can do. 

My tips to you are learn to plan and adjust your food intake through out the day. if you going to have a big dinner then have a light breakfast or lunch to make up for it.  There are many different ingredients you can substitute for lower calorie options and calorie tracking apps can help you understand if the ingredient your looking to swap in a recipe will make a big enough difference or not to justify it."
"> But I feel a bit disheartened and like I’ve wasted my hard work in the past 3 weeks because I have eaten 1700 cals (including those from exercise) - should I feel this way? 

Feelings aren't right or wrong, they're just feelings.  I try not to form opinions about mine, let alone others' feelings.

We suggest that the first week be just logging your regular food (not trying to lose weight).  In week 2, choose a target and eat with the target in mind.

Personally, it takes me 3 weeks to start hitting my targets reliably.  My inner child loves his food but eventually goes along with the program.

I like lose it for this - you can create recipes to either use multiple times if it’s exactly the same or just edit the quantities in an already created recipe. I find it really intuitive to use!

> How do I accurately calculate the calories without needing a scale? 

By buying the scale.  It was the best money I've spent in this effort.  Even though you can't carry it everywhere, use it when you can at home and it'll help calibrate your eyes and hands.  

Week 1 has some further ideas to supplement when you don't have a kitchen scale or measuring cups with you, but buy those and use them when you can.

>  I am using the MyfitnessPal app and I wanted to ask whether it is accurate or not?

It's crowdsourced and some entries are nonsense.   Try to find entries from USDA or institutions and be wary of those that seem too good to be true.   Look for those green-checked entries that suggest that they are more reliable than other entries.

>  I wanted to ask whether it is accurate or not? If I am making something in olive oil, do I need to input the oil separately or is it included in the dish mentioned?

For complete dishes where oil is part of the traditional recipe, you can consider it as already counted.    Where the oil is used for cooking and is absorbed up into the food you're cooking, you need to add the oil that you used.       If some oil is left behind in the pan, you can deduct that uneaten amount from the amount you're adding into your log.

Nobody 70+ kg maintains fat on 1200, you're burning something.   Did you start weightlifting?  Are you miscounting because you don't have a scale to check your portions?"
"I think I'm in the minority, but I really dislike them all. I find it a huge chore. I get how helpful it is, especially since my calorie goal is so low, but I can never do it for more than a day or 2 at a time. That being said, I am trying to log food more consistently. 

When I'm eating things that are already in mfp I don't mind it as much, like if I can scan a granola bar etc. what I really hate I hate when I meal prep  or make food at home and have to add and weigh every ingredient I used or try to find a recipe very similar. Again, I get it, i see how it's useful, I really do, but it just feels so tedious and time consuming.

I also hate how low it automatically sets certain goals like sugar. I have a problem with sugar, I admit that. But having any little item put me over my sugar goal was very disheartening. I keep eating less per day but I would have liked a way to set it at a goal that worked for me at the time and adjust it to what it should ideally be over a period of time. Like if I was drinking the equivalent of 4 sodas a day, set my personal goal at like 2 rather than automatically at like .5 a can.  I have gotten significantly better but that bothered me a lot at first. I felt like no matter how little sugar I ate I couldn't eat as little as it wanted me to. (That may be a paid setting, but even if it is I'm not paying $50 for it)

"
"When I just started out, I just wanted to count my calories to see where I was at. I didn't want to set a goal or aim for anything. Yet MFP and every other app I could find required this of you. It would be great if that was a feature to turn on or off. The red numbers and texts might be motivating for some but not to me at all. I would like to have the choice to turn them off entirely or just make the text black like everywhere else on the app.

I am down to having to eat 1370 kcals a day to lose 1 lb a week and it's hard. Yesterday I ate 1385 and was pretty happy, but that red -15 is so annoying!

It would be nice to be able to report wrong entries. 

Automatic conversion between metric and imperial. Sometimes thr best entries are in imperial units instead of metric. If something os typed with a serving of 4 fl. oz I would like to be able to input 2 dl and have it output the correct amount.

Same goes for serving sizes of the same unit. A Daim bar is 28 g per serving in mfp - if I choose to eat 35 g I need to bring up a calculator or get better at doing math in my head. It would be neat to be able to just type 35 g instead of 1,25 serving."

"Yeah that's fine, just different opinions just wanted to note mine so OP had all perspectives. I don't make friends on the app I just add people from loseit, helps me stay motivated. I agree the diary should be default page, that's typically what I log in for 90% of the time!"
"I measure my ingredients dry or uncooked, in grams. I use myfitnesspal though. 

For meat, the weight is usually listed on the package. If it wasn’t, I would put a bowl or plate on the scale, zero it, and then add the raw meat.

So if I was making rice and meat to last me a few days:

Measure out 200 grams of uncooked rice (~750 calories). If you’re using microwaveable packets, you can just use whatever the package says. You don’t need to weigh. 

Measure out half a pound of raw meat (250 calories for half a pound raw chicken breast) 

Add rice and chicken calories (~1000 calories)

Divide by number of meals I’m splitting them up into (so if I’m eating half today, that’s 500 calories). Leaving 500 for tomorrow."
"I get the wanting to do everything correctly and exactly and while it is important to differ between cooked or uncooked rice/pasta /quinoa or other things that absorb a lot of water when cooking it's not an exact science what your specific package of rice contains as long as its not seasoned or has extra ingredients except for brown rice. Look up calories per gram for cooked brown rice on your app, here is how my app (lifesum) logs cooked and uncooked brown rice :[brown rice](https://imgur.com/a/HRu3dkq)

Then cook your food, put your plate on the scale, reset the scale and then add as many grams of cooked rice you are planning to eat. 

This will be accurate enough."
"A cup is a standard for measurement of volume. Buy a measuring cup that says cup, and that is “1 cup.” 1 cup is how much stuff will fit in that cup. This is kind of inaccurate as you can imagine as 1 cup of rice will be more food than 1 cup of, say, broccoli florets. So measuring by weight proper via grams is definitely better, especially as exact amounts in a pouch or container could vary. Most labels should include a per gram on the label. For example, My packets say 1 pouch (250 grams) is 450 cals. So, I can measure my rice post-pouch and get, say 260 grams, maybe my pouch was a little extra filled at the factory. I know that 450/250 = 1.8 calorie per gram. So i ended up with 1.8*260 = 468 calories. Four meals is now 468/4 = 117 cals per meal.

If your rice cooks cooks in 2 mins in the microwave, I can guarantee that it is not as “uncooked” as dry rice actually is, my reasoning for the pouch holds. 

For a composed dish like pasta, the loseit app will have a recipe feature. Put in all ingredients; 2 tbsp oil, 1 can tomatoes, 1 lb beef, x amount pasta.
There are two ways you can go about determining calorie per amount eaten.
Easiest way is to eyeball it. If you are getting three even meals out of that, set the “total recipe size” to 3 servings and now you can log 1 serving of that recipe when you eat your meal. I recommend doing this, as it is super easy, and if you are eating all of it yourself or even splitting even amounts with someone else the difference doesn’t really matter as long as your plates look about the same.

Alternatively, you could weigh the cooked meal in grams (THIS IS FOR SERVING SIZE PURPOSES. Ingredients should stay as they are. You aren’t going to pick ground beef out if pasta and weigh that. Leave the raw meat weight in the recipe itself). Say my meal is 300 grams. You can set the “total recipe size” as 300 servings. If my bowl of pasta is 135 grams, i can log that as 135 servings.

In both cases, the important thing is to just make sure things look split up evenly. If your partner has 6 meatballs and you only have 1, you wouldn’t be accurate if you both logged “1 serving.” Just make sure things look approximately evenly distributed and cal it a day. If you are the only one eating your meals, it matters less. You are getting all the calories in from that recipe eventually, its okay if technixally on day 1 you ate slightly less of it than you do on day 2.

For actual cooked vs uncooked rice, the label should specify. My rice specifies 170 calories per 46g dry rice. If I’m eating two meals from that I just log 23 grams per meal aka 85 calories. If youre going to be splitting meals unevenly, then weigh cooked rice. Say my 46g dry became 100g cooked. That is still 170 calories of rice. So now, 170 cal / 100 gram cooked rice = 1.7 cals per gram. So if my bowl of cooked rice I pile in is like, 62 grams, that is 62 g * 1.7 cal/g = 105.4 cals. If loseit has this rice as “mil,” just input whatever mil amount makes 105.4 cals. If this kind of math is confusing, I highly recommend using the loseit custom food feature so you can input the food with measurements you use, vs having to use whatever exists in loseit entries already made."
"I went on a logging streak for 411 days... basically my entire weight loss phase, plus a couple of months of maintenance. I made a commitment to myself to log everything I ate every day for 1 year, no matter if I was on track for the day or eating my feelings in pizza and chips (though that rarely happened). I manually changed my calories throughout that time, sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing. I didn't add in exercise calories. The calorie goal that I set was what I stuck to. 

Eventually (especially during weight loss), you'll reach a point when 95% of the food you eat is already saved into the app. I use the loseit app, so pretty much every meal that I've eaten in the last year is already saved. So when I need to track its as easy as typing ""jasmine rice"" into the meal search bar, and then it will automatically pull up the 5oz of chicken breast, 100g of jasmine rice, 85g of sweet peas and .5 tbls olive oil that I was going to log since I keep my portions pretty much the same.. and if I planned to eat more rice, I could easily just make that adjustment. The same happens when I type in  ""Chipotle"" and it pulls up my standard burrito and chips and gauc. Now it takes me 5-10 minutes a day to log my food. It would probably be less than 5, but I spend several minutes trying to figure out how to meet my protein goal for the day.."
"I tracked for around 500 days at my longest streak and only stopped when I got pregnant and decided to take a break from it. Once I have the baby I’ll get back to it. 

I just made it a habit. Using lose it, it was pretty easy to type something I’d eaten before and it would pull it up. I measured most things on a food scale and guessed for restaurants. There were also plenty of days that I just tracked something general. For example on my birthday and big holidays I may track a generic bbq meal or thanksgiving meal and call it a day. As long as I am accurate 80% of the time, I continued to meet my goals."
"I'm at 66 days since switching to loseit. The right app works. The app has to be motivational in some way. I dislike mfp but keep going back to it when I have a fitbit. I used Noom for a year and the app is motivating enough to use for 12 months for me in 2020. This Nov. I started the loseit app and the data is displayed in ways I like, it has functions I need, and it shows you a streak count for closing out the day. It also lets you close out a missed day if you forgot to complete it. It also has an option to upload a picture of a meal, which is good for eating out with friends you can take a good pic and upload it or wait til later, and guestimate the calories better visually. It also lets you future plan meals for the week so they are easier to enter the day of."
"It does look like they are double counting as you’ve described, so it would be overestimating your discounts. Personally, I would just adjust your activity level to the one that best matches, and not use the calorie discount part. Those “activity calories” are generally not very reliable, and can make it easy to overestimate how many calories you need. There’s way to still have those workouts and steps log in lose it but not actually count towards daily calories. 

End of the day, youre losing weight, and that’s all that really matters, so do whatever makes it easier. Good luck!"
"I still count calories even five years into maintenance.  I understand how you feel. My life doesn't necessarily feel like a ""diet"", but both losing weight and maintaining my weight loss does take pretty well constant attention to diet. There was a post on here a couple years back that really stuck with me on this topic: [Monica Geller and her inner fat girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/5x6orj/monica_geller_and_her_inner_fat_girl/)

>I was watching Friends last night. Season 4, episode 2. Monica gets a date with the 'popular' guy of their high school days and Rachel isn't happy about it because the guy (Chip Matthews) cheated on her at their senior prom. Monica tries to explain why she wants to go on the date:  
Monica: Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I...I owe her this. I never let her eat!  
And that really spoke to me. Right now, I'm still a fat girl. I am in the midst of making a lifestyle change and at the end, I will reap the rewards of being at a healthy, lower weight. However, there will ALWAYS be a fat girl inside of me. A little fat girl who preaches overindulgence and instant gratification. I stopped at McDonald's on my way to work this morning to grab my usual coffee. My inner fat girl gleefully pointed out a delicious-looking blueberry cheese danish in the glass cabinet on the counter. I hesitated and started doing some quick mental math about how I could eat less later. There were little placards sitting neatly in front of each type of pastry. 330 calories read the one for the danishes. That was enough to snap me out of it. I wasn't even hungry!!! I had a good lunch in my bag that included a yummy 120 calorie tapioca pudding for my afternoon snack!  
I said no to my inner fat girl. And I'll be denying her many times (not all!!!) for the rest of my life.

This is me. I'm always going to have to remain vigilant to avoid regaining the weight. Some people don't. Is that fair? No, but that's life. It does suck sometimes."
"OMG I'm still fighting baby weight and agreed to be in a wedding in 12 weeks. I feel your pain! Good luck!!

Also, there are a bunch if really useful apps for this. I use myfitnesspal and if you eat similar things pretty regularly, you only have to do the math the first time. After that its in a ""recent"" column. Makes it much easier."
"I put a can of tomatoes in don’t you worry. I think you’re missing the point of what this comment was going for. I haven’t put the full recipe in because I was trying to explain a point. I’m not going for a cookbook based off a loseit thread, I’m trying to explain a concept to op…."
"If you can afford $20, join lose it for a 7 day trial, cancel it, & youll get a coupon for $20 for a year

you can scan barcodes & its community entries

I personally got the cheapest scale on amazon, lose it app, and meal prepping with aldi’s + publixes foods
and veggies from walmart"
"I use calorie counter by fat secret.  Can track calories, macros, your weight, there’s a diary option if you want etc."
"I'll admit I don't know the current state, but last time I used loseit! All the needed basics were free. Weight tracking, food tracking, barcode scanning, ect. Plus nice grafts. I've had a lifetime sub for years now, and I got that on sale for really cheap, so if you catch it on sale (which it often is) it's totally worth it in my opinion."
I tried mfp and lose it! Stuck with lose it because the interface is simple and not a lot of clutter. Ended up buying the lifetime plan because I enjoy using it so much. I do think they got rid of the scanner on the free side but either way it’s got a massive library of food.
"I used to calorie count using myfitnesspal and it would never last. I think I obsess over the numbers A LOT, especially being able to see exact numbers. So on days where I’d go over I’d feel like crap and on days I’m under I’d constantly find whatever food I can eat to fill the 1200/1300 calories and those usually end up being really poor snacking decisions. It definitely became all that I thought about all day and I’d go onto the app just to log what I think I’d eat the next day and when I fail to fulfill that exactly, I felt even crappier.

I’ve just started my journey again early November and I still look at calories online or on the food packaging, but I do a mental calculation instead of on a app. Sometimes I might use a calculator because math is hard haha, but I’ve found I don’t binge or feel like crap just by seeing rough numbers instead of exact figures. Also this reinforces how many calories are in the food I eat in my memory because I’m taking so much mental notes, instead of just scanning a food item using an app, so these days I’m able to guesstimate better and obsess less and less with numbers while still losing weight."
"Idk how myfitnesspal handles it but I use cronometer. 

In cronometer, you can simply create a recipe with the ingredients you want, most of which have typical US measures like tbsp cups etc listed with corresponding weights in grams. In the recipe creation, you can overwrite the total weight as cooked weight and you can set multiple different options for servings per recipe with your labels or you can enter labels and weights. Irrespective of If you entered any servings or not, it generates a serving labeled “full recipe - total weight g” and a “g” for 1 grams as serving. For your salad, it would look like “full recipe - 115g” and “g” if you log 52.67 as serving in “g” for example it would portion everything in the recipe such that the recipe would end up as 52.67grams you entered. If you get questions feel free to ask. 

Apart from that, in general, if you plan to finish your food within the week, you can create the recipe and enter a fraction based on your expected times you would eat that to finish it. For example, I finish 900g yogurt box in 5 meals with roughly equal portions so I simply write 0.2 servings of full box or just 180g instead of weighing it every time. If you think you would finish the salad in 2 portions, just enter 0.5 servings of the full recipe for your log and when you eat the rest again enter 0.5 servings of full recipe. Sure you might have eaten the egg part yesterday and ate the avocado part today but over the two days you ate that recipe and thats the important part. That you are accurate over time, over days and weeks, not one single meal. 

Sometimes alternatively, for lower calorie foods, below 200 cals stuff, I enter the full thing. Even if I dont finish it that day and put the remainder in fridge, when I do finish it in a new day, its free food in my calorie budget of the new day since its all accounted for. if i throw it later, meh thats ok too its some bonus weight loss now."
MacroFactor - [https://macrofactorapp.com/](https://macrofactorapp.com/)
"I like myfitnesspal but I would suggest subscribing if you could because it’s really in depth with macros. There’s also a steps feature. What I really love most about the app is the scan barcode feature, you can scan any food item and it’s automatically added towards your daily intake (you can also adjust serving size so if you’re doing 1/2, it lets you record 1/2 the serving!"
"I work FT, have a wife, kid, normal life and just count the calories. I use lose it. I eat fresh meals most of the time. I eat out sometimes. I’ve been on two vacations this summer and counted. I’m not entirely sure what is complicated about calorie counting. I just do it because the alternative is being fat and I don’t want to be fat. 

Maybe you could explain what the tough spot is for you and I could tell you how I manage that particular thing?"
How do you feeling about lose it making the barcode scanner a premium feature?
Thanks for the macrofactor tip. I have been using it for a week now and LOVE it!
"That is how I gained and lost the same twenty pounds over and over and over. I couldn't do it sustainably without either getting the fuck-its and gaining more, or turning to calorie counting to lose it. So I'm a calorie counter now."
"It's pretty subjective. Try a few of them and see which ones might suit your purposes.. I like lose it because it has a large database of foods, custom recipes and the full version is cheaper than any of the other ones."
"The Daily Q&A thread is the place for things you know are common questions.

Our Quick Start Guide has a list.  Most are free for the basics/essentials with a fee for additional features.

"I use lifesum and so far most things i entered where recognised correctly. (I live in germany so nutrial info is also avaible on the food item. Iirc thats not the case in US?)   
Only problem i notice are sometimes (rarely) missing nutritional data (like how much sugar or carbs or sodium; calories are given though)."
I’ll add that I just recently switched from mfp to cronometer and definitely see a more accurate calorie count but have found that mfp played to my laziness since most meals I made were there or an alternative could be found so I’m having to take time to create meals to cronometer. However I’m noticing when I do create meals I trust it’s calorie count much more than anything else I’ve tried. I’ve struggled to record consistently simply because of this but for the accuracy I’m giving it a fair shot.
"> can you direct me to some resources that strike a balance between being correct+precise, while still being convenient and accessible?

We need accuracy more than precision.  Let's start on the presumption that one 100 percent of our estimates are going to be wrong -- not EXACTLY right.   Some of our estimates will be closer to the truth and some will be farther.   Accuracy means that roughly 50% will be higher than the truth and roughly fifty percent will be lower than the truth.  That is what we are going for.  When this is the case, laws of mathematics such as averaging and the law of large numbers provide for a sum that is still accurate AND precise enough.

* https://www.google.com/search?q=law+of+averages
* https://www.google.com/search?q=law+of+large+numbers

Because of these properties of math, we can have confidence that as long as we are giving best efforts, we can estimate restaurant meals and foods that other people have made for us.  We can also appreciate this by looking at its opposites: not logging anything we're unsure of -- or always underestimating anything without a clear label -- These are surefire ways to be both imprecise and inaccurate.  We definitely don't want to be doing either one of these!   

Being accurate and fair provides for good precision in the total, and the total is what matters over time.  

Be a complete tracker. Do not forget the 'forgettables' such as condiments, cooking oils, small bites of this or that, or things that you would add to a salad like dressings or seeds.  Log all the way to the end of the day, even if you go over your goals. Even log your exceptional days, skipping nothing.

Buy and use a digital kitchen food scale and good measuring cups to measure portions, at least for the first couple months of counting.  You can also [use your hand to estimate portion sizes](https://www.google.com/search?q=Use+Your+Hand+to+Estimate+Your+Portions) as well as [common objects](https://www.google.com/search?q=Use+Common+Objects+to+Estimate+Your+Portions).   You will be calibrating your eyes to do this more quickly later, but for several weeks use these tools as often as you are able.   Use the scale when you can and it will help you keep your eyes calibrated.

> Things like cooking oil and dressings can sneak in hundreds of calories.

We should assume that dishes are made in a restaurant in a typical way, which is to use these ingredients if they're part of a standard recipe for those.  The website allrecipes.com Is a great resource for looking under the hood of basically any plate that's been placed before us.  It is not a goal of the website, nor the restaurants, to offer us the lower calorie options.  Both the recipe site and the restaurants go for maximizing our satisfaction with the food, not with the data.

One thing you may notice immediately is that the portions in restaurants are practically twice as big as we might serve ourselves at home. I typically ask for a to-go box and box up half of a meal when it is delivered to the table, so that I can take that with me when I go. Then I enjoy the other half.

Another tip is to take a cell phone picture of your plate so that you can log it later and enjoy the food while it is still hot. This avoids you wrestling with the databases as your food gets cold.

Compare your plan with our recommended plan to see if there are any insights that you should add.  https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick_start_guide

That's the method to start. Follow that guide and that timing, using your regular and normal food, and using portion control as your main tool for change. In later weeks, use the data to figure out if any foods need to be adjusted. All foods can fit, but sometimes we have to juggle or learn a new way to make an old favorite."
"Cronometer tracks iron and other micronutrients.

Edit-  you can scan foods into it and it does have ads unless you pay for gold, but it tracks what you need.  I haven’t used myfitnesspal in years, nor do I use cronometer.  I like the interface of Lose It much better, but it doesn’t track iron."
"I don’t live in the US to pretty much most brands are manually inputted. 

But it asks for percent iron and not mg which makes it really hard to input, as everyone’s percentage is different? We’ll not everyone, but it’s by gender and age range.I looked through different entries and saw that some people put mg anyways but the box is labeled percent. I couldn’t find a way to fix this to save my life haha.

So I switched to Cronometer. I like the layout and ease of entry better on mfp but it’s not bad. Shame they want to charge $20/month to unlock all the features, the us price in the currency here it’s only $57 for the whole year."
"I just use the free version of myfitnesspal. People complain about the app a lot but if you make a lot of your own meals and double check, it's not a bad program."
"I miss the bar code scanner so much on myfitnesspal but I eat basically the same shit for breakfast lunch and snacks, so at this point I don't care what I ear for dinner I'm not stressing it and this has been working for me all year and today I weighed in at 127 the lowest I've been since....at least 2017.


So that was sick."
"The free cronometer is really great :) been using it since 21st April last year and it's very straight forward but also gives you lots of info on macro/micro nutrients in an unobtrusive way.

I also like that the barcode scanner is free but for anything random that it doesn't recognise its really easy to add (either by typing it in or taking a photo of it and it can type it for you- depends on the packaging sometimes if this works) and it remembers it for next time you want to add it."
I bought lose it when they had the lifetime offer on sale. So maybe wait for one of those
"I'm in IT by trade, I ended up just writing my own copy of what MFP used to be like with PHP/HTML/JS and a MySQl database. 

It's crazy how much they want to charge for myfitnesspal, all of the features they locked behind a paywall didn't work worth a crap when it was free.  (the barcode scanning specifically)"
"Cronometer all the way. I've added tonnes of my own barcodes in there that aren't in the database. Pic of the front/back of the package, it auto reads the nutrition label and adds it into your custom foods, and you can even submit it to the cronometer database for approval. It's a dope program. Much better than any other i've tried.

Connects to samsung health too which is great."
Seconding all this! Down 75ish pounds over the last 18 months and used cronometer for all my tracking. I wasn't differentiating by meals because i mostly cared about daily totals. It also will sync up nicely with FitBit if that's your jam.
"You can always look for a different app. I use my net diary. It’s also not perfect, and some features are paid (like following specific diets) but the majority is pretty good imo.

There are still some things that I can’t put in grams, in which case I make my own “fooditem” and look up the average amount of calories in said item online, then use that as a guide for how much I consumed"
"Why wasn’t it? A unit of measure can be converted to any other unit of measure. 

Ex: 50g of broccoli is 1.7oz. 

This isn’t rocket science. I use the lose it app daily. Have for months and never been in a situation where I couldn’t quickly add whatever food to my daily log."
There is an app called pound a week. You put in your info and it tells you how many calories you need to eat a week to lose 1 pound. Then you input your daily  food like myfitnesspal. You weigh in once a week. It even tells you how many weeks you've stayed under your calorie goal or lost one pound. It's pretty cool. I don't like the way you input food. So I just calculate in mfp and log the total calories in poundaweek.
"Myfitnesspal does most of these things. I also have myfitnesspal linked with strava+fitbit, and the calories +macro nutrition that I log into mfp shows up in my Fitbit app too when you sync then together!"
"I used to use “Lose It.” I actually paid for the year ($30USD) so I didn’t have ads and could use some other features. I liked the user interface better than MFP. It connected with fitbit and could actually put my food log from lose it into the Fitbit app. It can scan barcodes, create recipes, and search a lot of items. Not sure if it’s offered in Norway though."
"It does seem to do all that I want from it, It is almost hard to believe fitbit does not do the same natively, why even have a food tracking if it only does it so halfassed? I have not tried to export the data from myfitnesspal over to fitbit yet but even without that I'm happy that I can atleast track my calories/macros like i want conveniently in an app. Thank you very much for vouching for it."
Omg yes! I only switched to MFP because i don’t want to pay for lose it anymore. I tried using the free version but I’m so used to the paid one that I just give in.

That might not happen. Part of your journey should be accepting that your body is pretty darn good just as it is. It's fine to be working on better health across time including carrying less body fat and its inverse of more muscle mass, but how you feel about that and whether you even perceive it is up for grabs. 

Our self image is negatively biased, frequently.  It's also laggy and self reinforcing, the kind of confirmation negative bias.  I'm not calling for the opposite, which would be some kind of narcissism, but how about some indifference even a preferred but indifferent attitude. You would prefer this change or that change to become evident over time but your mood does not depend on it."
"As a spread sheet oriented person I totally understand the appeal over an app. And I know a lot of the comments are telling you about the benefits of various apps, but I think you looking at the labels of everything you eat and logging it is the best start you can get. Doesn't matter how you track them the fact that you are is going to make you more aware of your own eating habits and that's the first place to start. 

If you do go back to to a tracking app, I know that myfitnesspal has a ""quick add"" function where you can type in the calories yourself and add it to a meal and they do have graphs you can look at that compiles all of the data you've entered.  

But again, if a simple spread sheet works better for you than stick to that, apps aren't the important part. It's being honest and conscious of your choices. Good luck! "
"I wouldn’t trust the barcode feature, or use the nutritional label directly and input your own foods/cross check to find the correct one. If there isnt a nutritional label, find one that is similar in ingredients and weight to cross check. It seems complicated but these are the hidden calories that will sneak up on you. 

Serving sizes will also differ (ie lifesums entry could be for a 100g product vs lose it for a 200g), so make sure you’re checking the serving sizes and even weighing it out if possible as there can be 10% leeway in how much more/less mass the product has. 

TDEE is gonna be arbitrary and there is no point trying to track it- if you continue losing you’re on the right track, if you stall for too long you’re probably eating too much. If you really wanna know, you can find an adaptive spreadsheet but that requires weighing yourself everyday, having accurate caloric intake information everyday, and logging for weeks before you get a ballpark TDEE."
"Once you've tracked long enough you can pretty accurately guesstimate how much you're taking in. Just stay mindful and keep an eye on your weight from time to time. The first time I stopped tracking for a long period, I ended up gaining 10-15 kg back...

&#x200B;

However I got started again and even then after a while I too found it important at some point to stop tracking (even just for a while) I had built up this like 500 day streak on mfp, and it was kind of becoming an OCD thing of not wanting to break the streak. So last time I went on holiday I decided not to track the whole time there. I was still eating mindfully, tried to hit my macros, just didnt track. It was a liberating experience. I did start tracking again after, but free from that streak pressure."
"This is a summary on how to count calories. It's long but trust me it's not as difficult as I might make it sound.
Download an app, myfitnesspal is one of the most popular because it has a wide database. On myfitnesspal you can enter foods that you eat, you can select a cane option on the app to scan the barcode of the food, let's use chicken for example. It will then pop up with the nutritional information for this box of chicken. You should be careful, this isn't always accurate. Double check it matches the information on the box. It may also give you as this the calories for 100g of chicken, but if you want to eat the whole box and the box is actually 300g, you can adjust that on the app to receive the actual calories. The app will also have a search function for other popular foods, myfitnesspal is so commonly used you should be able to find most brands of food, and it should save the foods you put into it, overtime you'll realise (like literally everyone else) you eat the same kind of foods often. Having them saved means you can easily just enter the name, eg ""Walmart chicken"" and find which it is. You can also search for common food items, eg a banana, and itll say 100 calories. This is a rough number that's always fairly accurate, assuming it's a normal sized banana, but a bit of variation doesnt matter too much in the long run. Another great thing to do is buy a kitchen scale. Say you want 200 calories of oats but aren't sure how much that is, figure out how many grams of oats that is, eg 50. Then weigh out 50g of oats.

You'll enter your details onto the app, your age, height, weight, and sex. This will give you a rough estimate for the amount of calories you need in a day. Myfitnesspal is again very popular because its pretty accurate. You can then select a goal for what you want to do with your weight. I recommend losing 1lb per week unless you're very overweight, eg I was 261lbs when I started, I cut down to 155lbs, so at the beginning I was losing 2lbs a week. Weigh yourself pretty often. I personally weigh myself everyday because I like numbers. Some people do it every week, it doesnt really matter too muchbut the important thing is you do it under the same conditions everytime. The easiest way to do this is to weigh yourself straight after waking up, after you visit the bathroom and before you drink any water or eat any food. The weight will FALL off at first, that's due to a decrease in water weight as a result of a decrease in food and carbohydrates. Itll start to slow down but that's normal. If you then find you're roughly losing the same amount of weight as you told the app you want to lose, good job. If it's too fast, eat a little more, if its too slow eat a little less, adjust the calories on the app as needed. The app will also have a cool graph to let you watch your weight changes. I personally only really entered the weights that went lower than my previous weights but I actually find the graphs look better when you enter every weight. 

Any questions feel free to ask me"
"M, 5'10, 27, 207 lbs

I have an ~1800 calorie daily budget on loseit.com. I use the stationary bike and Convict Conditioning, mainly, and burn about 2800 calories a week on my current routine. After factoring in exercise calories burned, I have a daily average between 1400 and 1700 calories, but I've had excursions as low as 900 net calories and as high as 2300 net calories."
"I’m glad yours seems to be accurate. Are you near a healthy BMI? My experience as a formerly obese person with an Apple Watch it that it is very inaccurate if your BMI is over 35. Medium accurate 30-35, and reasonably accurate below 30. 

Here is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/d5e0z6/accuracy_of_apple_watch_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) to my old data.

In general, for most of the people considering an Apple Watch/Fitbit/Samsung Watch, I would strongly caution AGAINST trusting it. Again, that is my own experience, but it appears to be more accurate the closer you are to a healthy BMI."
"Cronometer is great for this. With this app/website you can make custom recipes. For example, the smoothie I make for my wife and: I weighed everything out and entered the ingredients to the gram for cronometer. This gives me a basis for every time I make the recipe. I certainly don't measure to the gram every time, but as long as it's close from batch to batch I consider it close enough to log."
"Good app. I have since moved away from it. I need to move back. I am far too lazy to keep up my efforts for the years it is taking me to lose it all. Generalities are essential for me now. 

Never eat fried food. 

Make your own food as often as possible.

Eat fruit and veggies as the default. 

Exercise more than you think you should.

Love life, celebrate it. See the mist on a lake, see the sunrise over the ocean. Eat a nice sandwich on a mountain you just climbed. "
"I just downloaded the lose it app, and it also budgets calories much differently. Same exact stats as I have in MFP, and MFP budgets 1290 per day, while LoseIt only budget 883 per day. That seems a bit too low to me, but then again I have been stuck around the same 5 pounds for over 2 months using MFP. "
a lot of people actually have complaints about MFP so I'd stick with lose it
"I've also found lose it to be accurate. I do remember a few times that the callories were off on something I scanned, but lose it recorded it as 5 cal **more** than what the package said. I don't have any way to know if the exercise numbers are accurate, but I don't really log that anyway. I just eat at a deficit, then anything I burn is a bonus.

"I meant tablespoons, I'm gonna change that and also put the exact number that's being read to me on the mynetdiary app.   


But what you said about collectin recipe's really helped me feel less overwhelmed by it. Like you said, once I have a solid catalog of recipes calorie counting will be a breeze because I know exactly what I'm eating. I can keep building on it and have a diverse, healthy diet. Thanks for that tip."
"Then maybe don't use loseit and just use mfp? And perhaps start reusing recipes more than once? Even when I'm inputing a new recipe or doesn't take more than 5 minutes to enter all the ingredients and then later adjust the weight based on the real weight I used.

If you're not willing to take time to improve the ability to log then it seems to me you're just not wanting to log period. You have weekends, take an afternoon to create the database. Like I said in another comment, do you expect to just know how to beautifully and perfectly play a musical instrument without taking time to practice? If it's something you want to do, you'll take the time to learn.

That seems to be what you don't want to do, take time to learn and make the process easier and more intuitive. "
"I'm not seeing the issue. Search for usda Chicken breast Raw or cooked depending on when you're weighing, log. Search usda broccoli raw or boiled depending on when you weigh it, log. Cook however much rice you want, search for that type of rice cooked, log. If you're eating that more than once in your life those ingredients will be in your search history to find again.

I edit recipes all the time, sometimes with up to 10 ingredients. It's not difficult. You cut up or prepare the ingredients however you need to, weigh, jot down the grams on a board or paper or simply open the recipe in your phone and edit in real time. Do this for every ingredient. It's not going to take me 10 minutes to weigh my chicken breast and then change the weight in my app recipe builder. Nor does it take more than a few seconds to weigh a cut up onion and change the weight in the app. You're going to complain about the time it takes to weigh the ingredients and then change the number of servings in the app where the ingredient is already listed in your recipe?

I have no idea what mustard greens are. I just timed myself, it took me 5 minutes to search usda Mustard greens and find the entry for raw greens and then the last 4 minutes I spent on google finding out that black eyed Peas are actually called cowpeas and can be found in myfitnesspal by searching cowpeas (blackeyes) usda and then selecting the appropriate one you're looking for. Then open up your browser and use a site such as nutrition data to find the usda info to compare to make sure its the right one, then always use the one you decide to log. "
I use lose it. It’s one click to add food.
"You can quick add calories on mfp on your main diary. You just click the little three dots.

Entering specific foods and creating specific recipes is how you track accurately. Weigh the food, log the amount, get the calories"
"Sounds like you're off to a great start! MFP really has such a nice database (loseit too, from what I hear). It really does make it practical to track calories. 

Just a word of caution about scanning barcodes though. Almost all are perfect but some are really really wrong lol. It was all fun and games until I was getting overcharged by 50 calories on something I ate DAILY. I've been comparing to the label ever since.

Best of luck!"
"**EDIT:- There is no irony like when one has to eat one's own words. ;)**

**Thankfully for me, preparing meals ahead of time, calorie counting recipes and tracking have helped me lose 15 lbs in the 2 months since I made the following post. Leaving it here for your enjoyment**



Otherwise, how is it even accurate, just eyeballing something and estimating how much it weighs, when putting it into calorie apps?

Let me give you two examples - 

1. I order some chinese food from a local restaurant. There is no entry for their food in MFP or loseit. They make standard chinese dishes but I don't know if they use less oil, more veggies, etc from whatever is in those apps (which again are user submitted and I don't know how correct or wrong they are; plus there are multiple entries for the same dish by different users with different calories)
 How would I log this meal, even if I had a kitchen scale to measure?

2. Let's take a home cooked meal - say mexican, indian or even italian - there are a bunch of ingredients that go into each dish. Even if I go to the trouble of adding up the weights and proportions of each ingredient, and come up with a calorie total for the whole dish, how can I know what a serving is?

Even if I know that the dish I made is X servings, that's assuming the calories from each ingredient is evenly distributed in the dish so when I serve myself 1 serving, I know exactly the calories I'm eating (e.g meatballs on spagetti - do I weigh meatballs + spagetti separately, or just measure the put together dish?)

All this seems way more complicated than eating low-calorie, portion controlled food 90% of the time and allow oneself a cheat or two once in a while. No? Please change my mind...

I like the app cronometer, it is the most accurate and easiest to use."

"Yeah Fatsecret is pretty good, I've been using it since day 1 of my weight-loss journey. One advantage is that if you add something to the database you also need to input macros. In MFP I believe you only need to input calories, the macros don't seem mandatory, so fatsecret might be a better choice for your app. I don't know about any API though. Anyways I would be interested in such an app so I hope you'll post it here when it's done. Or if you need alpha or beta testers maybe I can help with that. "
"I'm not frustrated about the speed I'm losing weight at, not in the slightest. If I lose it faster, I wouldn't be building or maintaining muscle.

I'm simply curious why my numbers don't add up with what my calculated TDEE suggests. I'm curious about the technicalities."
Thank you for your kind note. I didn't intend to be vulnerable this morning when I went on loseit but I was when I read the comment I posted on. It's because Op made a point I've struggled with. Obviously being on social media when you feel vulnerable is a mistake. You're right I should have left and not come back.

"How tall are you? How many calories a day do you eat?

Use the TDEE calculator in the side bar and calculate your TDEE, substract 500 and you've got your calorie goal for the day. Now you'll have to figure out how to keep your goal while not being hungry and feeling satisfied with the foods you eat.   
The easiest way how to cut calories is replacing high calorie items with something with fewer calories.  
For example, your granola for breakfast, try to substitute it with just handful of rolled oats, or you may have a look at overnight oats for breakfast.  
Also, if you are not drinking more creamer than coffer in your morning coffee, you should be fine. Black coffee has almost no calories, so if you get used to drinking it black, you can have it  all the time without adding calories. If you can't drink it black, look into some plant milk to add instead of creamer. I can't help you in that much, since I actually really like my coffee black and hate anything added to it.

If you love salmon, how is your portion size? Salmon is healthy, but at the same time it's pretty fatty fish and quite high in calories. Try to alternate it with chicken meat, turkey, or different kind of fish with fewer calories than salmon. Tilapia, cod, sea bass, halibut or catfish are al great options. Also shrimp is delicious, high protein and low calorie choice.

Also, everyone is different, so don't look at how many calories you should it for breakfast per lose it app. Someone needs more food in the mornings and has lighter dinners, someone prefers no breakfast and bigger lunch, someone eats one meal a day. Find what works for YOU in a way that adheres to your calorie goal. For example, I'm usually not very hungry in the mornings, but that changes n the afternoon and evening. Therefore, most days I don't have any breakfast, sometimes I'll have some greek yogurt/skyr/quark/protein pudding for snack (100-150 kcal), but not every day. I like to have bigger meals, so I have fairly big lunch (500-800 kcal), mid afternoon snack of some vegetables or fruit, bigger dinner (500-800 kcal) and sometimes second dinner of cottage cheese with fruit of veggies (I'm just riding the tomato wave) or cup of halo top ice cream. My calorie goal for the day is about 1600kcal and usually don't have trouble sticking to it.

Remember that your body burns more calories by just existing, than you'd burn by exercise. So calculate your TDEE and go from there."
"33 F here, When I first started calorie counting I focused more on the number and not what I was eating to get to that number. It made me feel like I could do it and I did. I've lost 90 lbs counting calories. As you get use to counting you will realize you want more protein to help keep you full. I've done many different diets and this is the only one I've been able to stay on track with long term and lose a ton of weight. One big thing is to make sure you are weighing/measuring your food and using an app to track the calories. The lose it app has a calculator to help you find your daily calories. If you have any questions I'd be glad to help. You can message me anytime."
"Does your partner have a degree in nutrition?  Sounds like he's just following the ""latest thing"".  Some people don't do well on a high protein diet.  And he's wrong about bread. Healthy bread is one that has many (like 12 to 15) whole grains IN the dough, not on top of the loaf & made with unbleached white & whole wheat flours.  

It's better to watch what you eat (counting calories religiously can also be detrimental) & exercise.  My daughter is a certified Athletic Trainer & teaches her clients good, healthy food without preservatives & added salt (check the label on you boneless chicken breast for ""brine""/salt) and daily exercise will get best results.  It's all about a lifestyle change.

She told one morbidly obese client that it took her 10 years to put the unwanted 100 lbs. on, so don't expect to lose it in a year."
"I can’t tell you how many times i started dieting and gave up because of how demotivated people around made me feel by telling me “i’m doing it wrong” 

You can read up on what he’s talking about but I personally use myfitnesspal app, it counts your fat, protein and carb intake and nutrition in general, i’m like you i’m mainly concerned with calories but when the numbers are there i try to change my choices a bit to meet them, for example I switched to greek yogurt for the higher protein content.

You definitely don’t have to do that it might be a good idea to talk to him and make sure he knows that you’re not interested in his advice and that he needs to either support you or stay away from the topic all together."
"We are going to estimate a lot in this multi-week, or multi-month, or multi-year effort.   Some of those estimates will be too high, and some of them will be too low.   If we make 100 too high estimates averaging say 100 calories, and 100 too low estimates that are also about 100, the sum total is still totally right.  This is the gist of the **[Law of Large Numbers](https://www.google.com/search?q=law+of+large+numbers)**.

So always log everything that you can, using the best estimates that you have.   Your skills will improve with time and trials ...

I traveled Europe for 30 days, logging all that strange-to-me food, and came home and my weight was up by only 2 pounds, so my totals were a little off by about 250 ㎉ a day -- 100% by eye (no food scale) and guess-estimating.  I was aiming for maintenance and I think that's pretty good.

"My usual daily ""goal"" is 1537 in the my fitness pal app. I tend to say ""goal"" because it helps my frame of mind more than calling it the max or the limit. I've been doing extremely well these past few weeks (it helps when I eat breakfast late in the day) and keeping at an average of 1319. 

From about January til March I'd end up at an average of between 1500-1600 most weeks because I didn't want to deny myself too much. I'd allow myself to eat one serving size of whatever I was craving (mostly chips or pretzels), and try not to eat after dinner. I will say last night I ate ice cream out of the container and ate what I wanted thinking it might be one-ish serving size. I ate 38grams of ice cream and was satisfied with how much I ate lol, a serving size is around 90.

~Edit: the way I measure ice cream while eating out of the container is put on the scale before and put it in the mfp app (basically list it as eating 740g of ice cream) and then measure it after and subtract by editing the entry (it went down to 702, therefore I edit the entry to be 38g.) Because I list it as the before amount I don't have to remember that number. In starting out you can put a bowl on a kitchen scale and measure out how much you've served yourself. I find I eat less when eating it directly because I do not feel the need to finish what I have served myself.~

Alcohol is my bane however. I did start drinking Truly's (100 calories per) and ciders (150) which tend to have less calories than beer/wine, at least the ones I drink.

Also there are MANY TDEE calculators online that will tell you the minimum calories you *need* plus maintenance calories and deficit calories depending on how much you want to lose. It depends on your height, age and activity usually, just to make sure we're truly the same. 

Also pro tip from others here, focus more on your average *weekly* calories than your day to day. It's totally okay to go a few hundred over on one day if you keep on par/under every other day. It's easy to beat yourself up when you see you've eaten 2000 calories but if you've stuck to 1500 all the other days that's only an average of 1571."
"Yep! I'm big on achievable and maintainable goals, when I saw that mfp recommended only 1237 calories I tried it for a day and it was actually impossible. I came here and found out that 1200 is really a bare minimum kind of thing so I upped it to 1500 (and losing .5 per week). 

The most important thing for me in the beginning was just limiting portion sizes. If I wanted something I would only allow myself one serving size. It made it so that I could still eat what I wanted which meant I didn't feel like I was denying myself so much. And it worked! Along with getting rid of most sweet snacks, I rarely have more than one or two cravings a day.

I also replaced small twist pretzels with giant rods so that it's more difficult to eat unconsciously lol."
"I use the Cronometer website because the entries are reliable. I don't eat much processed food (so don't mind entering the data from the packaging) and I never eat out. I also like the micronutrient tracking feature.

Here's my [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/5sxbk3/im_a_college_student_and_developer_struggling/ddj13d7/) from last month as to what I would like to see included in a calorie counting app."

I used to just do it on a notepad and then calculate per serving or ounce. But then I started tracking my protein more carefully and found the recipe builder in loseit to be better for that. Now that I’m used to doing it in the app I like it much better because I can play with amounts of ingredients as I cook to get the calories/macros i want
"Yep, I was put on the anti anxiety meds and my ADHD brain went crazy getting dopamine from food. Put on 6 lbs in 2 months.  If I didn't have an overeating problem before,  I do now! Off those meds but those 6 lbs remain and it took me 6 months to lose it. Square one , it is."
"The loseit app shows the weekly totals so that helps me mentally when I go over on a daily allowance. If the math maths, it’s math."
Use the lose it app and click create recipe. Put the total amount of each ingredient you intend to use and select the number of servings the recipe will make. After you have cooked everything weigh the entire meal and divide that number by how many servings the recipe makes and that will give you the weight of one serving.
"This is very encouraging! So many of us get the ideas in our head that weight loss is a race and we have to lose it quickly or else we have failed. But in two years we can either have slowly lost without torturing ourselves, or we can be in the same place having yo-yoed and struggled for two years. 

I mean, there are other options than that, but from my experience, I'm most likely to go hard and then fail and then gain and repeat the cycle. 

I like that you reframed your thinking around a meal being 1100 calories to 500 calories. It doesn't sound like a lot but when you actually are eating healthy foods, 500 calories can go a long way!

&#x200B;

Congratulations on your success!"
"i use the lose it! app.  it gets data from iphone's 'health' and 'fitness' apps, plus data from my wyze digital scale.  i have created in-app recipes for homemade stuff like tuna salad, beef stew, etc so i can get the real nutrition info, plus the app has info for a gazillion ingredients and restaurant foods.

there are more good features, but i already sound like an advertiser.

i track calories, exercise, fasting times, macro nutrients.

F67 / sw 214.8 / cw 174.5 / gw 150"
"I like FatSecret. Terrible name but for macro breakdown, I thought it was better than mfp because I am mainly tracking protein and carb intake"
"I use the free version of MyNetDiary on iPhone. The barcode scanner is great and it doesn’t pester you with subscription popups, and the UI is generally great. 

Didn’t like myfitnesspal’s barcode scanner and food library as much, but this could be a country thing."
Ive downloaded lose it but macros are hidden ?
"in my experience, 16:8 by itself only helped me maintain my weight.  I had to do more to lose it and CICO definitely helped with that.  Just the act of counting makes you reassess your diet entirely.  You'll look at soda a different way."
"WAY depends on your stats and exercise level. Try an online calculator, or weight loss app (I use loseit)."
"I recently transitioned to using both IF and calorie counting and I’ve seen really nice results. I’ve lost 5 pounds in my first two weeks. I expect this to slow down significantly as 2.5 pounds/week isn’t sustainable for me long term, but it’s nice to see the scale move. 

My fasting window varies depending on my hunger level but having an eating window has made calorie counting much easier for me. 

I have used myfitnesspal in the past and recently transitioned to using lose it, which I really like and highly recommend. I haven’t used fat secret."
"Using a calorie counting app helped me realize how much I was over eating and what healthy portions look like. My husband and I love to cook so the app we use, loseit, allows us to put in our own recipes and get a better idea of the calories for our meal choices. Even if you are eating ""healthy foods"" they might still pack a big calorie punch and an app might help identify that. If you do decide to use an app, stick with it for at least a month so you get into the habit of it. 

During my IF journey the scale has been both my best friend and the kid on the playground taunting me. It was great early on when my weight loss was pretty consistent. Every time I would step on the scale it felt like I was accomplishing something. Now a year and a half in, the weight loss has slowed down and so it does not feel as useful on a daily basis. So my advice is to use the scale but not be tied to it. Pictures for me are the real motivator, because the scale is not the whole story. 

Best of luck!"

"[Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) is pretty awesome.
Scan the barcode on the food label or enter in staples like meat, vegetables and dairy etc.

Log *everything* that goes into your mouth.  Calories are sneaky little bastards and will add up much faster than you think."
"Yeah, if I'm starving myself nonstop. Otherwise, no.

I don't understand why people are afraid of calories. It gives me peace of mind. I love counting calories. It takes me 10 seconds to log my calories after every meal. I open my phone, spreadsheet, log my calories, close it.  I've memorized every food that I like to eat at this point. I don't even think about it. I'm like a robot.

Fuck everything else. Too much anxiety. Will I lose weight this month or cry in my pillow at night wondering where I went wrong? blah blah blah. With counting, I know I'm going to lose weight, and how much approximately. It's an amazing feeling. Why do anything else? So much time lost if you fuck up 'eyeballing' things. Why risk it?"
macrofactor is the best app you can possibly download. no questions
I’m using cronometer. I started 16:8 last month and moved to whole food plant based 2 weeks ago. It has been a savior giving me calories as well as daily RDI targets and macros. The good part is that I can take the info I need and ignore the rest. And it’s free.
">So, if that happens, being exact with the calories daily doesn't matter because all the calories are going to be going towards my weekly TDEE total. In the end, it's about hitting your weekly total defict goal rather than your daily goal.

Really? I was going with a use your daily calorie allowance or lose it approach..."
"Kimchi stew and thai stir fry are both available in myfitnesspal so you can count calories. It doesn't need to be perfect, but you really do need to do some counting of calories.

Even being in the ballpark will help.

There's no getting around the fact that if you're gaining, you're almost certainly eating enough to be in a calorie surplus.

Keep a food log or use an app to count calories for a week or two. That should be enough to at least get a better idea of how many calories you're actually consuming in an ordinary  week."
" Another vote for myfitnesspal app, I've used it, and you can create your own recipes/meals so you don't have to enter all the ingredients every time. Other apps, too, that's just the one I've used. The QR scanner is wonderful! If you don't already have a food scale, I would recommend getting one. I learned a lot about portion size! Also, someone else said recipes already in the app are close enough, and I couldn't agree more. For some of us,  me included, that can be challenging but better to track ""pretty close"" than get frustrated and not track at all.  Speaking from experience, that mentality can help find balance with other commitments on those days when ""life happens"". Good luck!"
"Fitbit Integration.

If you put in a weight tracker, you might as well also put in a meal/macro tracker. If you could have the functionality of cronometer, with the socal aspect of MFP, that would be absolutely baller."
"Punching your metrics into the tdee calculator gives [this result](https://imgur.com/a/UoJ96Pz)

If you are eating at 1800 calories,  you are creating a weekly deficit of 9,492 calories which is about 2.7 lbs weight loss per week. 

There's information that I've come across that indicates 2lb is the safe cutoff for healthy weight loss. Anything beyond that can cause issues with one's gallbladder (gallstone formation) due to how much fat your body starts using for energy which causes the release of too much cholesterol in too little time from fat stores.  So at 2.7 lbs per week for that sedentary TDEE estimate,  you're over that healthy loss limit:

""As the body metabolizes fat during rapid weight loss, it causes the liver to secrete extra cholesterol into bile, which can cause gallstones. Fasting decreases gallbladder movement, which causes the bile to become overconcentrated with cholesterol.""

Are you not exercising any? Because even at the light excercise TDEE in the screenshot of 3616 calories... eating at 1800 calories puts you at a weekly deficit of 12,712 calories which is about 3.6 lbs per week lost. 

With all of that said, I've seen A LOT of posts on /r/IF, /r/CICO, and /r/loseit where people clearly lost wayyyy more than 2lb per week and didn't run into gallbladder issues. It makes me want to speed up my weight loss because I'm targeting 1lb-1.5lb per week range due to fear of gallstones... but I feel like I could be losing more and I'm just overly worrying about something that may or may not happen thus limiting the speed of my progress. 

Anyway,  I'd recommend you talking to your doctor and running your daily calorie goals and weight loss goals by them... and get their advice. 

Good luck with the journey!"
"Why is this so wrong. Most everything I read on loose skin is its a combination of how elastic your skin is genetically, and more importantly how long the skin was stretched out. Actors who gain 60 lbs then lose it again within a year wont have looseness, but lifelong obese skin has nothing to shrink to. Rate of loss is irrelevant iirc."
It has only been 3 weeks and you’ve lost over 5lbs! That’s not “slow.” You didn’t gain it in a day and you won’t lose it in a day. Just keep it up.
get the myfitnesspal app and yes weigh your food. You can get a cheap scale then use the app to determine the amount of calories in that food keep a food diary using the myfitnesspal app and keep within your calorie goal. Calories in calories out means that if you eat more calories then you burn you get fat. If you eat less calories than you burn you lose fat. It really is that simple. You sound like someone who is just making excuses.
"Finally some sanity.

Posts from IF keep making the front page. Three years ago, it was posts from /r/keto (with some from /r/Paleo). Before that it was posts from /r/loseit. Before then it was posts from /r/fitness.

I'd really like to see current progress pictures from people who made the frontpage 5+ years ago. Weighing food, counting calories, eating according to the clock, wholesale eliminating food groups is not a sustainable, healthy relationship food."

I do hate the ads and the clunky interface, but it's worth it IMO for everything else."
"I reinstalled lifesum again, gonna give it a couple days try, just to see"
"Myfitnesspal! I just use the free version because I has every feature that I need. I tried a few other apps but none of them had a huge database like mfp. The only downside is you need to double check that the entry you’re selecting actually matches the nutrition label on your food. If you just want to rely on the app and never read the actual labels, I’ve heard Cronometer is good for this. The database is smaller but the entries are typically accurate."
"I also live in Japan. They are extremely good about having exact calories on all of their store bought food, however they often base their calories off of 100g or 100ml over the amount actually in the container so pay attention to that. I often scan things with myfitnesspal and have to manually create the food, but its worth your time to do so with foods you often eat. 

There are somethings here that you cant get a hold of such as egg whites, and other common health foods in other countries, but they do have a lot of veggies, meat, and especially fish that are awesome and often way cheaper than America. 

Japan is not a magical place and you can easily gain wait here if you over eat despite the people around you being so skinny. I often have to remind myself that Japanese people dont eat all the sweets and delicious (like the breads!) things available here every day they only eat them every once in a while. Make the fried foods like karage and kushikatsu a treat only, but things like sushi, yakitori, and okonomiyaki are good foods to get while eating out.

Some of the lowest calorie Japanese meals I make are: Okonomiyaki (cabbage pancake which is DELICOUS), Nabe (Japanese Hotpot), Gyudon (beef and rice bowl), Oyakodon (chicken, egg, and rice bow), Gyoza (Dumplings), and Just a lot of fresh fish especially salmon and tuna.

"  If you don't find another app, I honestly had a pretty good experience with loseit and myfitnesspal. Obviously not everything was in it, but a surprising amount of products. Entering the details yourself is pretty easy, especially on LoseIt, and you only have to do it once, so I never had a problem with it. If it's a product from a europe-wide grocery chain, I try looking it up both in english and in the countries language I bought it in, often times I find a match! 

Barcode scanning within the app can be super-super helpful too, I feel like myfitnesspal's scanner works better than LoseIt's (it's faster). Sometimes I can't find something in either of the languages, I scan it, and it's in the database but in slovakian or something. On loseit I just change the name to something I understand and it works like a charm!"
Cronometer is free and has a free scanner.  I know for myfitnesspal they put the scanner behind a pay wall for US residents.  It's the only reason I switched apps
"I use the loseit app and I log recipes as 12 servings, or however many. When you create a new recipe it gives you a spot to give it a name, under it it will say 1 serving. Click on the one and change it. When you log it in your food diary the first time it will load the entire recipe, change the number of servings to how many you had. For things like bread where not every slice you cut is equal weigh it after baking and log the grams as the serving number. So if it weighs 454g log it as 454 servings then it's super easy to figure out"
"Mine updates all the time and I haven't noticed any real change, except that instead of 1/4 1/3 1/2 3/4 portion choices they added 1/10 1/8 etc as well which I love. It doesn't make a huge difference really but it does make everything a bit more accurate. I did notice that beside the '1 serving' in the recipe builder there's a little downward facing triangle, not right beside the words but to the right of it, maybe you have to hit that instead of the 1 on yours. If you're trying on an existing recipe make sure you're at the edit recipe option.

I hate when updates change an app drastically. They ruined mfp to me. I had to always go on the browser instead which I found a bit of a pain so I switched to loseit after trailing off course. "
"I like cronometer because I like data, it has all my macros and micros. If too much data is going to be stressful myfitnesspal is super easy to use"
"i used to use my fitness pal religiously but a month or so ago made the switch to lose it and i wouldn’t ever switch back! they’re not wildly different, but lose it has a much more inviting look (to me) and feels more user friendly! i’d try downloading both and see which one you gravitate towards the most; that’s what i did when i first got curious about lose it, and found myself not opening mfp anymore!

one big drawback of lose it however is that you have to purchase the subscription in order to have the ability to plan meals for days ahead (you cannot go further ahead on the calendar than the current day). with my fitness pal this isn’t an issue! kind of annoying when i wanna plan a meal out in advance or something but not a huge deal for me, personally "
I've used both and I'm happier using loseit. I like the recipe builder so much nicer.
"I used lose it when I was a freshman in college in 2015. I redownloaded it this year, and still get really annoyed when it tells me that I’ve gained 30lbs since 2015, even though I’ve lost 30 lbs since I downloaded it again. Other than that, I love lose it! I use the free version and I think it’s all you need."
"I like the 


I've learned about macros using the free version of FatSecret.](https://fatsecret.com/) .  It's easy to use. All you have to do is answer their questions.


 It guides you in planning macros, and automatically  calculates daily and weekly summaries of 14 macros/nutrients.  It g ability to pre-plan days, save meals, track weight, etc. It has free bar code scanning and no ads or pitches to upgrade.  [It's the API behind Amazon, FitBit, Lifescan, Samsung, etc.](https://platform.fatsecret.com/api/)"
"TLDR; Cronometer is the best app for this but it could also be a good idea to learn how to interpret nutrition labels on your own


All you need to do is divide your portion by 100g and then multiply by the “per 100g” calorie amount. For example, if you eat 63g and the product says 400cal per 100g, you would do 63/100*400=252cal for your 63g portion. I recommend using the calculator app on your phone for the actual calculation. 


The same logic works for serving size- say the serving size is 28g and has 110 calories and you eat 44g, you would take 44/28*110=173cal for your portion. 


The general formula is (amount you ate) / (amount in a serving) * (calories per serving). It’s a good skill to learn to avoid mistakes, and just in general.


But if you think that’s too complicated and just want to plug something into an app, I would suggest Cronometer, because it’s database is the most accurate. Many people will suggest LoseIt or myfitnesspal, which both have their advantages, but also have a lot of entries with errors so I would not recommend using them if you can’t do the math yourself to make sure the entry you’re using is accurate."
"There's the app see how you eat that people use to post their day on here. It has the pic and the calorie count right over the pic, but the app won't calculate get calories in the meal the person has to do that.

This concept would be amazing but it's impossible to guess accurately from a picture. Not only would there be no way for the app to know how much chicken is actually on the plate, it would have no way of knowing if it was baked plain or with 2 tbsp of oil on it which would add hundreds of calories to the dish. I use the loseit app which has a picture function. I can take a pic of my food and select the guess that matches. I took a pic of canned sliced peaches and got options ranging from potato wedges to oatmeal. Even if it guesses right you have to pick the right option then log the weight or amount you had "
"quite literally just eat 1200 calories daily (or a bit more depending), i use cronometer"
"I use loseit! The database is kind of small, But since I mostly eat from scratch it has all the raw ingredients I could want, And if you have a packaged thing you can scan in the barcode and it'll put in the information.   I also find that it's calorie estimates are a tad more accurate for me, Most TDEE calculators have me a little low but loseit seems about right. 

&#x200B;

I'd say it's accurate as long as you're honest and are good at inputting the right portions, I've lost 5-6 pounds since I've started using it and it matches up with my deficit exactly."
The my plate app lets you put in recipes so you don't have to add up individual ingredients and has a barcode scanner.  Not familiar with mfp and if it does the same.  It also has reminders to enter meals.
"Apps like loseit, or myfitnesspal, have a recipe builder. You weigh the ingredients as you cook then add them to the app. Set the number of servings and it calculates the calories in your meal. It's a bit time consuming the first time, but the next time you make it it's already saved. You'd still want to weigh as you cook so it's the same nutritionally but you can pull the recipe up on the app and use it as your cookbook as you cook plus alter it in any way you need. Like if you used 100g cheese for your recipe before but only used 90g this time it takes a second to change it but it's easy peasy.

There's no real trick, but the recipe builder functions are great when you cook your own meals regularly. 

Lots of things don't need the recipe builder and you'd use the regular long. Like I did chicken, broccoli, and a baked potato. I weighed each of those and logged them. Then I quickly logged the butter I used, and the balsamic vinegar I used on the chicken. Seasonings like garlic powder have so few calories you don't really need to worry about it, I only add them when I use the recipe builder so I can recreate the recipe easily."
"I was a Noom user!
I unfortunately had a less than stellar experience with their food/diet counselor they assign when you become a paid member, so I didn't use that particular aspect of their service for long, but I do like the app.

I can confirm that you CAN track calories without the attached service of the counselor (who is there for accountability and goal setting, so if you can do those things yourself -- all the better). I did like the interface a lot -- ended up switching off of it only because I really wanted the macros (which my current app, lifesum, does in a roundabout way).

(edit to add: the app and calorie tracking is free; if you pay a monthly fee, that is when you get a counselor and a series of wellness articles to help you change your mentality re: food)."
"While many people here will suggest food scales, and are absolutely not wrong, it's not impossible to do it without a food scale. Your recorded amounts will not be nearly as accurate compared to using a food scale, but if you either don't want to purchase one or can't afford to, it's possible to lose weight without a food scale. Personally, I use myfitnesspal (free version). I'm an avid baker so I have a fairly good idea of what certain amounts look like on a plate and just ballpark. I also am not super strict like some people are and allow myself some leeway and some maintenance days here and there where again, everything is ballparked. There is no 1 correct answer, you just have to find out what works for you."
Moved to cronometer after MFP took away their barcode scanner and am finally feeling like I have fully adjusted. Hoping they don't try and move it behind a pay wall!
"So far, bar code scanning is still free on  [FatSecret.](https://fatsecret.com/.) Visually, it is clean with no pop-ups, ads, or pitches to upgrade to paid. 


 The free version  has also has daily and weekly summaries of 14 macros/nutrients,  ability to pre-plan days, save meals, track weight, etc. I'm told it has a good international database of foods. It's the API behind Amazon, FitBit, Lifescan, Samsung, etc."
"I'm sorry you think this is unpleasant. I don't believe there was any miscommunication. I do think you have moved around a bit on which point you're trying to argue.

Again, OP was feeling bad because her husband wasn't being supportive of her counting calories. All she wanted was a measurement of the total product. He proceeded to give her a hard time about it and she was upset. She came here to vent and get support. She eats this item regularly with her husband. He makes it. She has logged it based on a store bought product in the past. She just wanted to be a little more accurate this time around. It was a reasonable ask with an unreasonable reaction.

Your response to that was to tell her to be more intuitive about her eating. For her to estimate her calories. You even talked at one point about eyeing calorie counts in muffins. 

Not everyone can do this. She expressly pointed out in her post that calorie counting is what works for her. Not everyone can sacrifice 100 calories here and there. Nor does everyone want to.

Furthermore, judging by the way your clothes fit can be fine for some. It's not for others. Sometimes if your clothes don't fit, it's a battle to get back on track.

I am not saying your recommendations are completely wrong in a general sense. They are just wrong here. Some people follow your philosophy and it works for them and that's awesome. Theoretically, you should try to get to a point where your eating habits are sustainable. What is sustainable is different for everyone. Some people literally want to log 312. 

This is a sub where people are trying to stay in a certain calorie range. Telling them to guess at what their intake is counterproductive. Your advice is way more appropriate for r/loseit or something like that."
"I like Cronometer because every food item has a grams option which works great paired with my food scale. And also because they verify each new food to confirm the nutritional information is correct. I lost with MFP in the past, then cronometer after my first baby, and now using Cronometer again after having my second."
It works like a regular scale and you can track calories by inputting a regular scales food weight in to an app like lose it but I like this one because it also shows nutritional value and daily % since I find that on apps like lose it sometimes those are inaccurate.
I really like loseit app. I’d always used mfp and just switched. I’m sure they lost a lot of money with their full page ads and loss of scanner. So stupid. I do have the premium lose it app but it was super cheap and I really like it! Also gives me motivation to use it since I’m paying for it
"I switched to cronometer after the mfp barcode thing and I love it SO much. It's so much easier to use my own recipes with the way they use the by-weight feature.

Oh! And you can scan ingredients into your recipes too, which is amazing."
"Actually I think sometimes these problems are more internal and psychological than just calorie counting. It might certainly help to be more on track with myfitnesspal and meal prepping and such, but I think it is also important to pay more attention to your mental health and self care. Eating shouldn’t be an emotional outlet and that’s not establishing a good relationship with food. I think as you improve your internal problems these food problems would go away too. We are all here for you and I hope you will get back on track soon! Good luck :)"
"I'm definitely going to be the odd man out on this one... I use Waistline and participate in OpenFoodFacts. They do not have the vast databases that MFP or loseit or cronometer have, but they are privacy friendly and 100% free without advertising. If you are passionate about the freedom of health and nutrition information, and about privacy rights, I strongly recommend participating in OpenFoodFacts. They need volunteers to scan barcodes and enter nutritional info!"
"i've always used mfp.  
I love it because you have a huuuge database of food. Even if you live in small countries. You add however many meals you like and change the names (meal 1, snack 1, breakfast etc). You can see your macros and add some of your favorites. Like iron, calcium or sodium. You can also connect it to fitbit and heaps of other apps. You can edit recipes or whole meals. Most foods have measurements for 100gr, 1 gr, 1 tea spoon, 1 table spoon etc.  You can log your excercises and it adds extra calories to your daily allowence. And much more! I currently use the free version, not sure if the paid version is worth it. Maybe if you want different calorie goals per day."
"Ok so I'll say one thing about cooking yourself and weighing it. Here's what I do: I use the recipe part of myfitnesspal and start with 1 serving. After I see the total, I break it up into how many servings I want based on the calorie total (e.g. If I typed in a stew and it would make 1000 cal total, I would probably decide on 3 or 4 servings).

Then, I just estimate the servings. If you are the only one eating it doesn't really matter if your serving is a little too big one day and a little too small the next day, because it all evens out if you just count them all as one ""average"" serving.

For the cocktail issue, I would just estimate how much you think you're drinking and count that. I have no idea how much you're tasting but estimate 300-400 cal for that?

For the dinner parties, I think an intermittent fasting approach may help you. I've read a lot of positive things on here about that. Also, just work on eating progressively smaller portions and you will definitely see results! I love to eat and cook too so I  understand your difficulties. It's hard but just take it one step at a time! Also I will say that the holiday season is probably a particularly difficult time to start counting due to parties and everything so don't get too frustrated with yourself! "
"Upvoted.  Don't worry about downvotes.  I think of it this way -- people are hungry and cranky here.  It's just part of the deal.  

> 2) weighing or measuring the whole finished dish 

This is the best way if you're going to portion it differently.   Let's say it comes out to 76 ounces.   Put in your recipe servings as 76 servings of one ounce each.  It's ridiculous sounding but it's the best way, because then you can accurately enter a 5-ounce helping or a 12-ounce helping.    When I do this, I title my recipes as 'per ounce' in the title so I am reminded what I did.  

> He whipped up a fruit salad that contained (I think?) banana, mango, and persimmon. I don't know how much of each was in the salad.

I know from experience that fruit salad is about 12 calories per ounce.   I'd probably go with that.   

A key thing to remember is that errors done once fade in importance.   Errors repeated daily multiply in importance.   So if you're uncomfortable about being 200 Calories off in a friend's luncheon, it's 200 Calories during a week where you'll burn 12000-14000 Calories.   But 200 per day at your at-home meals will total 1400 out of 12000-14000  and that's worth being more precise about it.    

Worry about the problems that can have the most impact.  Let go of the ones that won't.   Just do your best on those infrequent things and any error you make will be minor.  

> I am a cocktail bartender. I'm very good at my job, but to maintain form I need to taste test anywhere from five to twenty improvised cocktails a shift, each with as many as seven different ingredients in varying quantities.

Taste and spit, like the wine pros do?    Try to have more faith in what you think it tastes like?   Reduce to 5-20 per week instead of per day?    I have no experience here -- just do your best to cut that down.   

A shotglass of rum is 100 Calories or 1.5 fl oz..   At the end of your shift, estimate how much you took in and log it.

If you think they're heavy, go light.  Some tips here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/3w8t4l/parties_buffets_potlucks_and_similar_food_events/

> Measuring or weighing these on the fly can really fuck with my head when I'm in a creative flow state. Do I do it anyway? Do I only do it for hevay-calorie stuff, like oil and butter?

Expect this to go slowly for a while, and count everything.   Over time, you'll get a knack for what matters and what doesn't.  I could tell you what I already know, but that would rob you of actually knowing it.   All you could do is presume I'm right -- be able to say ""I heard that something something has no calories""  -- so do it all.   Learn to become efficient with your own experience so that you can do it with confidence.

"The sustainability is absolutely key. I also saw a post on r/loseit about this recently, I wonder if I can find it. It was about how we need to keep in mind how we want to live when the weight loss is “over,” because really it never totally is. In previous weight loss attempts I definitely went more extreme and fizzled out fast. This attempt was more sustainable, but I desperately needed a break still. It’s a lifelong learning process."
"USA American here.

On the subject of burgers, yesterday I went to McDonald's mainly because it was a right turn and turning left for Taco Bell from where I was would have been more dangerous.  (My original plan was to get a regular taco.)

I bought a $1 Hamburger, which was the product that McDonald's opened with for $0.15 each.  Outside of a brief failed experiment 15 years ago when they temporarily changed whether they toasted the buns, only the price has changed since 1955.  It was 250 Calories in 1955, and it is 250 Calories today.  

Which got me to thinking, that burger made McDonald's famous.  For decades, they touted the billions of burgers they served right on the sign!  Although that product hasn't changed, they sell very few of them today.    We want Big Mac, or a Quarter Pounder, or cheese on it.  They'll gladly sell us that.   

But if you want the original, what people ate in 1955 before there was an obesity issue in the USA, get the $1 Hamburger.  It's a classic, it fits well within our calorie plan, and it's a keeper for me.

Regardless of what app I'm using, I always cross check with one of these databases.

Also important to make sure you're distinguishing between nutrition info for raw/uncooked food and cooked food.

"Dude, you can eat up to 1500kcal and still lose weight. It may not be fast but you would still lose weight and probably get a better idea on how to maintain it as well.

For general information on losing weight I found the sidebar (or community info on mobile) of r/loseit and r/xxfitness helpful. "
Totally agree. I end up making my own entries for a lot of really basic things like apples or chicken because there are so many bad ones out there. Even on mfp some of the green check entries are way off. 
"I use myfitnesspal app. I have a food scale that weighs in 4 measurements (mostly I just use oz or grams though) and I weigh most things before or after cooking them. 

The app also has a bar code scanner so I can scan foods that I buy and it'll automatically import the stats, then I just need to enter the amount I eat.

When in doubt or when eating out, I just search the app or the web for similar meals and round up. For home cooked meals the app has a recipe feature where you add the raw ingredients and then tell it how many servings and it figures the stats for you too which is really nice."
"Wow we’re in super similar situations, although I’m probably closer to nonbinary than I am strictly a trans man. I don’t really care what ppl call me tho lol.

Idk if it’s available on android, but I use the app “lose it!” to track my calories. I just use a free account, but I don’t think it’s super expensive if you do get the paid version. 

Honestly, I don’t bother to track my exercise from my rehearsals/classes/workouts. I just use my phone to track steps on my walks, and the app automatically gives me bonus cals for that, which is enough for me. But if your exercise is just for weight loss and not for other purposes like mine is,  then tracking all workouts and not just steps might be better. 

I aim for at least 65g of protein as a bare minimum. I’ve heard 100g recommended before, but in the context of low-cal diets that’s pretty idealistic honestly. Maybe some days I get that high, but most of the time I eat a more balanced mix of carbs/protein/some fats.

Also, I will forever worship sugar-free electrolyte drinks.

Idk if any of that actually helps, but I’m glad there’s someone else in a similar situation to me 😅"
"I feel the same way about this way of eating!! Congratulations on your progress!!

Have you tried the lose it app? It really has helped me stay on track. It has a free version that does basic tracking and a paid version that has more features like scanning barcodes etc…"

"So what I did was I took a cooking light magazine recipe that provided a nutritional breakdown: Chicken Picotta, 4 servings, 459 Cal per serving. I ran the recipe through both of these calculators and the myfitnesspal calculator. 

HappyForks - analysis differed from recipe statement by +311 calories per serving. It also did not recognize EVOO and instead changed it to mayonnaise(?). It was easy to copy/paste the recipe, but it was very difficult to edit once it was submitted: 1.) Their recommended adjustments were very strange and you could not make your own adjustments or additions to fix that, 2.) If I wanted to adjust anything other than the flagged items (like the auto change to mayo or the serving size), I had to start over again. I could not click on any item and adjust it. Full nutritional analysis given (but was it accurate??).

VeryWellFit - analysis differed from recipe statement by +148 calories per serving. Easy to copy/paste recipe and adjusting items after submission was easy. Recommended adjustments were reasonably good. I wished there was a manual entry capability for the really niche items that the calculator did not instantly recognize (whole wheat orzo is a little weird, for example and I wanted to just feed the nutrition label facts to the calculator, but I could not). Full nutritional analysis given. Differed a bit from recipe.

MyFitnessPal - analysis differed from recipe statement by +63 calories per serving. Input was a HUGE pain because you had to enter/verify each item one at a time. For the most part the database for recommendations was extensive (possibly drawing from the USDA standard reference database, I believe?).  Partial nutrition analysis given. Covered the macronutrients, enough for most dieting perspectives.

So far, I am thinking MFP does the best job with accuracy. VWF is good for quick glance. HP did not show well with the recipe I tried it with.

Thanks for the advice so far guys! Let me know if you have any other recommendations please!!"
"My school has registered dietitians that regularly create food labels for dining hall foods, I've spoken to one of them. While lots of foods at my school are on myfitnesspal, the foods themselves can change frequently, including the macros and calories, which then get updated labels.

Notice the date on the top left corner, that's when the food was last updated. I've seen calories on a few foods get updated a few times since the start of the school year as their ingredients would clearly change."
"1. You're already a healthy weight, so is there s reason you're counting calories and working out so much? We have to ask because we get a fair number if eating disorders here. I don't want us to give you advice on losing weight if you're going to.run.the risk if becoming underweight.

2. You're right that your watch has to guess about calories burned. They can't factor in your overall body composition, exactly how you move, etc. When labs tested equipment that tells you how many calories you burned, none were right though Apple's guesses were pretty good.

3. I don't do anything with net calories so I had to look this up. My understanding is that net calories are calories you eat minus calories you burn (both exercising and existing). 

This page explains it like this: https://support.myfitnesspal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032273692-What-are-Net-Calories-

""This means that if you exercise, you will be able to eat more for that day.  For example, if your Net Calorie goal is 2000 calories, one way to meet that goal is to eat 2,500 calories of food, but then burn 500 calories through exercise.

""Think of your Net Calories like a daily budget of calories to spend. You spend them by eating, and you earn more calories to eat by exercising. We do not recommend that women consume fewer than 1200 calories, or men fewer than 1500 calories, on a given day.""

I wonder if the tiny calorie amounts you're seeing are the amount they are saying you can eat over your regular calorie count. We call that ""eating back"" your exercise calories or workouts. Often, we don't recommend eating it all back in case your tech overestimates how much you burned. But you're a healthy weight,vso you could certainly do so or eat half back if you're concerned."
"So, search for the map my run app. You can connect it with mfp and it has lots of exercises aside from running that you can choose from that you’re doing. Rowing, stationary bike, kickboxing, running, walking, hiking. Whatever. It’s a decent way to track without a smart watch. For doing crunches or pushups or something you can search for like ab workout or body weight workouts. It won’t be 100% accurate but it’ll be good. 

If you’re hungry or exhausted and you have a calorie deficit go ahead and eat some more trying not to go over. If you’re still hungry then go over some! Imo. Listen to your body. It’s good to have a tracker to give you an idea but if your body is telling you you’re still hungry you should still eat. Just choose the right foods. Eating 200 calories of potato chips certainly won’t keep you as full as a plate of quinoa and steamed veg or meat. 

If you’re not hungry you can try at keep it at your 1300. But if you did super strenuous activities, again... don’t worry about it and keep your body fed. Like, if I’m going on a hike on a weekend then I definitely plan to eat more because I use so many calories to do that. My body needs food. But if I’ve just done some light weight training or a long but leisurely walk I keep it pretty similar to a seeentary day. 

Does that help or make sense?"
"(Just to add in re the recommended macros on cronometer)

You can manually alter the ratios by going into settings in bottom right hand corner then targets then macronutrient settings and change them to something more suitable for you."
"I use fatsecret. Is free, with a barcode scanner and the database is quite decent. 

I can also add meals photo which is quite useful on social events (take a quick photo, estimate later).

I tried myfitnesspal because it has a Garmin integration, I personally found the app not that good and went back to fatsecret."
"MyNetDiary. Used to use lose it before scanner was a paid option. MyNetDiary is Free, with free barcode scanner, and works well."
mynetdiary is the best. free barcode scanner and macro tracking!!
I like ‘my net diary’. Lose it I think won’t let you use the scanner unless you pay for it and I’m a cheap ass
"Thanks I’m going to keep trying lose it for now, I like it, but it seems cluttered at times. I’m completely new to calorie counting and am doing an hour of cardio a day, plus a separate workout. One question for you, would you recommend doing highly active or somewhat active, if you were doing an hour of cardio but work an office job? I’m confused about that option, because it’s says highly active is for individuals who work an active job and somewhat is for people who sit most of the day. My job is very sedentary, but since I’m working out daily I think I’m highly active. I appreciate the insight!"
"Cronometer. So many features. Meal to recipe, copying meals, etc. Slower than I would like. Often makes me click many times to get the keyboard.

Started with lifesum. That was fast and simple. Great barcode scanner. The problem was that it had too few features. You couldn't set the recipe end weight as grams, only up to 99 portions or something like that.

My macros + was the worst. It had so many fundamental flaws."
That makes much much more sense!! Especially when looking at the carb g on the other one being 90 vs the 35 or whatever on the lose it app. Happy that helped a bit!! It probably is just variations in food logged for the rest then.
"Yeah, I used it forever, too. Got weight tracking in there for over a decade, easy. Used it since my ex-husband, so over 12 years as well. I still have the premium, actually.  I ditched it for lose it. Got lose it premium because I like features. It seems more positive and somehow has helped a ton since Aug, lost 25 lbs so far. 

I did noom for a while and used that. Didn't lose weight doing noom. 

I used to use spark people before mfp until my account got hacked and I lost it."
"I really like lose it! I don’t know about my fitness pal, I did try it shortly a long time ago. Lose it allows you to easily scan barcodes and save meals. I think I chose it over MyFitnessPal because it just seemed simple and easy to commit to."
"Love lose it! So intuitive, inexpensive, easy to use. In two months only one thing has not come up under the barcode scanner. I love the easy to use recipe builder for meal prep. I can track the same meal from yesterday with the touch of a button. It makes tracking easy. I love setting macro goals and tracking those in addition to calories. I love that it gives me the option to eat less during the week and more on the weekends. It is phenomenal."
This is loseit! My graph is my pride and joy since I don’t take pictures or measurements I just like looking at that line sometimes even daily haha
"Great job! You didn’t gain it all in a day, you won’t lose it in a day. But you know what? You’re doing it! Bravo! :-)"
"Just today I decided to download the lose it app to compare it to MFP. In my opinion (based on logging 1 day of food), MFP gives you more in the free version than lose it.

Main thing for me was that free lose it doesn’t let you see an actual number or % for carbs/protein/fat. Also for the days tracking, I found most items either were inaccurate or weren’t in lose it compared to a much better success rate in MFP.

BUT I really like the layout and interface of lose it, so depending on what features you want, or if you’re happy to pay, lose it might be fine for you."
"Hmm on mine it does give me a pie chart, but when I tap on the pie chart it takes me to a page about upgrading to lose it premium.

Definitely feels like everything I tap on links me to the upgrade page, but the paid version does look very cool, and I am still jealous of the inviting UI compared to MFP."
"Life sum is free very similar to mfp

Recently discovered nutracheck and it's extremely fantastic but it's a paid service"
I just switched to loseit a couple days ago (paid $20 for the year’s subscription because I was that pissed with MFP). And I actually like it better than MFP so far. Really clean interface and lots of features but its still close enough to MFP to be an easy transition.
"i use loseit. has the barcode scanner for free, recipe function, etc"
"Exactly. Since mfp allows users to submit food entries into the database, there's a lot of room for error and the barcode feature helped eliminate a lot of that. They probably caught wise to how useful it was and decided they weren't going to give it away for free anymore 😠"
"You can use the slider to adjust a generic amount of calories. But if you want to set a specific number, you need premium. It’s on their own website: https://help.loseit.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043057853

Idk why I’m being downvoted. It’s right there in plain language: “This article is all about the Fixed Calorie Budget. Please note, this is a *Premium-only feature.* A fixed budget is a daily calorie budget that does not change regardless of current weight fluctuations.”

ETA: here is the website that shows you can only use a slider: https://help.loseit.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007404728-Changing-Your-Calorie-Budget-and-Weight-Loss-Plan"
"I use Yazio but there is MyFitnessPal, loseit and many more calorie tracking apps that help with that."
"Thanks! I use cronometer but you have to have the paid version to seperate by meal, otherwise it's all lumped together. It's pretty reasonable, though. Less than 60 for a year."
"I really like carb manager. It has the best variety or foods and measurement options. I used cronometer when I first started counting and was interested in nutrition because it breaks down your vitamins and all that, but it has less food items then carb manager.ir also has a pie chart of your macros"
I am using my macros+ but a personal trainer that I was going to use did recommend the cronometer app too.
"A dedicated loseit user since 2014 - I find it to be more customizable  than MFP. And if you email them, you can get half off premium."
"Everything. It has the same database.

Recipes are easier to make

You can copy certain meals or full days

It's a COACH. You choose a goal, fat loss, gain, maintenance, reverse diet. Check in weekly and it literally changes your macros and tells if you have gained or lost too much.. Also takes into account if you are close to menstrual cycle. It also asks what rate. So right now I've been in a 6m surplus gaining 0.3kg per week. If i lose, it ups my cals, gain too much, decreases.

You can also have higher days and lower days. I tell it i want weekend higher days, so it changes the rest of the week to account for this.

Its 100 times whar mfp is. Including the premium."
"They have said they don't do free trials because of how little it's priced anyway. 

To me, it's well worth the money- especially if you can't afford a coach.

10 pound a month is a steal for what you get  tops mfp by a mile!"
"I use cronometer. It's not the path of least resistance. At the end of the day, if you want to track your calories it's going to take effort on your part to do it every day consistently - there's no way around that. There is no app that exists that will do it for you.

Another option is you pick a macro that is either your priority or your nemisis. So for example:

* if you want to be sure to get 128g of protein every day - then just track your protein intake and eat your proteins first - the premise being if you fill up on protein you won't be hungry for other things. OR
* if carbs are your downfall then only track your net carbs so you're not exceeding your daily limit

For this you can use pen and paper."
I use loseit free version but have used the paid version in the past and it was definitely more convenient. Once you track meals for a few weeks it's pretty easy to just type a generic approximation of your meal into search and you'll get some result that shouldn't be more than 100 calories off what you ate. Not perfect but better than you giving up and doing nothing that day!
"There's an app where u can literally take pics of your food plate and the app guesstimates the kcals and macros. But ofcourse, this would be quite a bit inaccurate and unreliable. Especially with hidden fats, oils, etc.

I still feel your best bet is an app like cronometer. Where you have a large database. But u can also make your own custom meals that you frequently eat. Its worth the investment in time. The app is free. Hope that helps!"
I love how I can just scan the barcode and/or multi-select items. Definitely many things make me glad I switched from MyFitnessPal to cronometer.
"> and the app guesstimates the kcals and macros. But ofcourse, this would be quite a bit inaccurate and unreliable. Especially with hidden fats, oils, etc.  
>  
>I still feel your best bet is an app like cronometer. Where you have a large database. But u can also make your own custom meals that 

What's the name of the app?"
"On both lose it and chronometer you can add protein/other goals and swipe between them on the day-food-diary-summary view. I generally keep mine on protein and then manually look at calories if I want to, but the option exists to set it up to not see the cals (though I’ve never seen the ability to completely disable cals and not have them easily available if you want to see them)"
"I use MyFitnessPal. I’ve used other apps, such as cronometer, but always end up going back to MFP. It has a larger library, even though you have to aware that a lot of it is inaccurate. I can count on it being close enough to make mental adjustments as I eat throughout the day. It definitely is not the best option for vitamins and minerals though. Even if they did provide tracking for those, I would highly doubt the accuracy, which is muy importante when dealing with vitamins and minerals. 

I personally use the app for calories in vs out, protein intake and keeping an eye on sodium and sugar intake. Everything else I just try to get it in through out the day one way or any other. It’s a work in progress."
"What apps are you using? A lot of these apps are user supported, so the food/nutrient/calorie info may not be accurate. Using those apps would be like using Wikipedia for verified quality source. 

There is a site (and app) called [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) that uses scientifically reviewed [data sources](https://cronometer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018239472-Data-Sources) for their foods from the USDA, NCCDB (Nutrition Coordinating Center Food & Nutrient Database), CNF (Canadian Nutrient File), and IFCDB (Irish Food Composition Database). The NCCDB used in Cronometer is curated and maintained by the University of Minnesota. They reference other databases from the Netherlands, UK, and Australia. 

Furthermore, any user data inputted into Cronometer is verified with the food manufacturer."
"Counter point.  I hated myfitnesspal after 2 years of using it but love Loseit. Found it’s just wayyyy faster and cleaner. 

- get a scale.  Calorie counting is not even worth it without a scale.  They are cheap.  
- log in grams. It’s more granular.  There can be a lot of calories in a .1 of an ounce.  
- don’t log veggies.  Yes they are calories but I find the “reward” of what feels like free calories encourages me to eat them more.  Snack on some cucumbers. Yes please.  If I missed adding 100 calories because I ate a bunch of carrots and tomatoes so be it.  
- if you have to pull an estimate out of thin air estimate high especially if it’s a restaurant.  
- I find skipping breakfast makes it much easier to not over eat.  Having 2 medium sized meals to me is far easier than 3 small meals.   It also means less calorie logging and less likely to burn out doing it. 
- put in recipes for things you commonly eat.  I have recipes for everything.  My smoothie, omelets, salads I like.  If you have to add ten items every time you make a smoothie it’s more likely one day you’ll be in a rush and just skip it then your day is off and you stop logging.  Making your most tedious log entries a single item helps A LOT.  Also, makes it easier to stick to your hopefully heathy recipes.  Some days I might want to add 50grams of cheese to my salad because I’m craving it by my recipe calls for 25 and I really don’t want to update  it or add more so I’ll just to 25. 
- If your spouse cooks but doesn’t calorie count get a post it note and pen in the kitchen so they can drop down items and weights so I can calculate it while eating.  
- I connect Garmin to Lose it and love seeing my budget go up when I work out hard.  It’s all automatic so just log my workout and loseit adds the calories in.  It will even adjust my daily activity level with my exercise to try to be more accurate 
- Sometimes I’ll log my next meals calories before I eat.  Helps me stick to it knowing I won’t have to do anything in the app if I don’t add food or change it up.  Using my laziness to do the right thing.  
- Once you have a target calorie level and are being honest about calories eat up to that level.  If you are doing 1800 calories a day and you are only at 1200 after dinner try to bring it up closer to 1800.  I find every time  I’m way under my limit for the day I end up falling off a day or two later.  Keeping it consistent makes it easier for me to keep going. 
- When I’m really lazy I might do things like just add a sandwich from a restaurant instead of logging all the items in the sandwich I made.  Like if I made a BLT at home but I didn’t measure anything because I’m lazy or in a rush I’ll just find a BLT from a restaurant and add it but make it definitely higher than my own. If I guess mine was around 500 I’ll pick one that’s 700.  That way I “reward” myself by taking the time to be accurate with a larger budget.  
-oh and you might feel like going over your goal too demotivating to log it.  Do it anyways.  Your goal should be accuracy first.  I’ve had days I went 1000 calories over and still logged it.  I’d rather know that just turn a blind eye.  

A theme you might have noticed is that I try to make doing the right thing the easy and rewarding thing and having my laziness motivate me.  Works for me but maybe not you."
"That's what I do on myfitnesspal. Thing is when your final recipe contains a lot of water like beans. In myfitnesspal, I list each dry ingredient's weight in grams and for 'number of servings' I put the sum of all ingredients in grams. And when  I have to log I just weigh my portion again and put that number as my servings for the meal. It's all good when your final cooked recipe has most of the water evaporated. But when you have water I think it's weight will also be reflected in those grams when I will be portioning so calories would be a little exaggerated won't they?"
definitely cronometer. it doesn’t trigger my ED like MFP does (you’ve gone over today’s calories ! this contains 6g of fat ! like shut up lmao) it’s just like “hey you get a lot of nutrients good job” so that’s nice
"it has a huge database, so pretty much all chains and other popular restaurants have their nutritional data from the menu on myfitnesspal. you just search 'subway spicy Italian footlong' or whatever you're eating, and it'll most likely have it in there"
"As others have already said in this thread [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) is great for tracking micro-nutrients of your diet. It uses several databases, including the USDA database. It provide you with the possibility to create your own recipes and add to your diary. 

However, Cronometer lacks the possibility to compare multiple food items. If you want to compare nutrients in different food items, then I would recommend [Nutrition Calculator](https://nutritioncalculator.net/). It uses the data from the USDA database, and has good and clean charts for comparing nutrients in different food items. You can also create your own recipes and see their nutritional information.

MyFitnessPal is good if you only care about macro-nutrients, as they have limited data on the vitamins and minerals of the items in their database."
"Amazing review! Thanks for sharing. Personally, I hate the picture based display of Wholesome. I'd rather just have text to quickly read. 

I personally use cronometer and think it's definitely worth it as an app. One feature I especially love about cronometer is the ability to add multiple Notes to each log. So I can write if a food upset my stomach, or if there was a reason my weigh-in was higher than usual, or a list of my vitamins I take, or if I was feeling sick that day, etc. Great for little reminders or observations. "
" [https://cronometer.com/](https://cronometer.com/)  is pretty good for tracking what you eat, where you also can see what micro-nutrients you get from the food you are eating.  

 [https://nutritioncalculator.net/](https://nutritioncalculator.net/) is pretty good if you want to compare the nutrients for different foods. You can also create recipes and compare the nutrient profile of them.

I have also used MyFitnessPal back in the days when all I cared about was the macros. It was great for tracking calories and macros, but it lacks the functionality of being able to see the micro-nutrients."
"Check out calorie king. I use myfitnesspal, but agree with you. Anything that isn't the same as what I find on the label I create a food entry using calorie king. Allows you to do everything in grams or ounces, whatever your preference is."
Maybe cronometer? It tracks macros as well as micronutrients and seems geared towards whole foods.
"I made my own spreadsheet in Google sheets, so I can access it at home, work, or wherever. I have a sheet with all the foods I expect to eat, and another sheet with a week's worth of days that I fill out as I eat. I use vlookup to pull the numbers from the foods sheet (but I've heard an index function is better). I like having full control of the information shown - for example, I could add a fruit/veggie/dairy column right next to the calorie column if I wanted. It took a little while to create it, but I'm pretty happy with it and prefer it to mfp, etc."
"Thanks for the response -  you can do macros on loseit as well (which i preferred aesthetically to fitnesspal) but I'm looking for the categories above (differentiation of fruit/veggie/dairy, etc). , instead of just the 3 - carbs, protein and fat. 
I guess similar to an app that might provide a checklist for people who take multiple medications or need other repeated reminders daily."
"I like www.cronometer.com

You can do weight loss/gain, but if you're interested in tracking nutrients, there is tons of information.  It's also got a web version if you're not smartphone friendly.

Just be aware though that certain nutrients (e.g. iodine, omega 3s) are very poorly listed and you won't find good data in databases (all based on the USDA database) for them.  It's not a fault of the tracker, it's just not commonly taken.  So for those, a bit of googling will tell you iodine is in seaweed and vegan sources of omega 3s are flax/hemp/chia seeds."
"Believe it or not, myfitnesspal can actually be used to ensure you're either consuming a caloric surplus or eating at your daily maintenance. If you go online using your computer, you can adjust your macro-nutrient intake goals, sugar/sodium intake, and track micro-nutrients as well. The app is definitely designed for those losing weight, but I've done just fine using it to bulk and ensure proper micro/macro intake. "
"The best macro tracker would be www.myfitnesspal.com, they have a HUGE database of foods and after using it for about a month it pretty much uses itself...and they have a mobile app. The problem with tracking micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) is that the actual amount in a given volume of food varies based off of a number of factors, including how the food was grown/raised."
"myfitnesspal tracks vitamin a, vitamin c, calcium, and iron but the daily totals will not be accurate so take it with a silo of salt."
This (cronometer) is pretty great for what you get for free and it goes down pretty granular details so will probably hit what you want. Plus it is still pretty easy to use from experience.
