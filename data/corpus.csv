"I want to use this so bad but I feel it should have a rest day Thursday then do the rest, do you think that will help you more?",general fitness
You absolutely must incorporate squats into your leg workout as well as deadlifts (either also on leg day or on back day). Those are two of the three most important and effective lifts that hit well beyond your legs,lower body
"Taking rest on friday, after one complete cycle.",general fitness
"I can't do squats and deadlifts due to lower back injury but i will add them once i feel better. 
Thanks man",upper body
But what if your other muscles are actually sore due to progressive overload? Assuming that’s what you’re doing and you are trying hard to build up that muscle!,general fitness
Apologies - makes total sense then. Be safe. Maybe try hack squats before you even do start squats when your back gets better just to ease into it,upper body
"Thanks, Do you think, i should include any exercise for front delts ? Cause i am confused Front delts gets a work in a lot of chest exercises.",upper body
Overhead shoulder press would be good. I think you are right that you already hit the front delts with chest but shoulder presses would be a good addition. I think best is rear delts which you already are doing,upper body
"Yeah i can add shoulder press for sure. Thanks man.

To add to injury prevention. Try to keep your strength ratio of quads to hamstrings as close as you can. Obviously quads are going to be stronger. So doing these compound movements is important! I like doing RDL’s now and then to really murder my leg bicep. Hahaha. ,lower body

"Are you working out at all right now? If not, I'd just start with walking 30 minutes 3 days a week. When you have that under control, stretch it to 5 or 6 days a week. And then start adding a little more time, etc.

Food will be most important, but it sounds like you already know that. Aim for a small calorie deficit. 

If you're having trouble keeping your appetite in check, try upping your protein intake by 20% or so until you're over 100 grams. And take your sleep seriously.",general fitness
"I find it has been easier in my 40s. There were no apps in my 20s, nor were there air fryers, and fitness knowledge was absolute dogshit in those days. It’s probably best for you to focus on weight training but try to get steps in too at another time of day.",general fitness
"Strength training is most important and you can get a good workout in 20 minutes. I would do a 4 day split of chest, back, legs and shoulders.  Stick to compound exercises like bench press, upright row, squats and shoulder press.  No need for arm isolation as they will be worked on the back, chest and shoulder day.  Try to get cardio in when possible, even just a brief walk will work wonders.  Get a calorie counter and set a 500 to 1000 calorie deficit being sure to get in enough protein. Without knowing your weight shoot for 150 grams.  Weight loss is more difficult as we get older but we are also smarter. ",lower body
"I would do strength training 3 days per week and cardio the other two. If you can get a bit of a walk or some kind of unplanned exercise in over the weekend even better (basically just be active doing pretty much anything). If you miss a morning, you miss a morning. Acknowledge it and move on. 

At the end of the day though, do whatever you'll do. Any exercise you'll actually do is better than the ""best"" exercise plan that you don't do.",general fitness
"I (39F) have fibromyalgia too, and the combination of chronic pain, fatigue, and overall emotional stress from the fibromyalgia had me stuck for so many years that I kind of developed a fear of movement. I thought I was moving a lot more than I did in terms of incidental exercise and I had gained weight despite a fairly (for a lack of better words) healty diet/lifestyle in general. Tracking my daily habits, it turned out I was a lot more sedentary than I thought. 

So, I decided to increase my overall energy expenditure (walking instead of stairs etc) starting in January this year, keeping it consistent for two months before I felt a lot better and felt ready for the next phase.
My goal was 7k steps a day, but I'm usually way over that without even thinking about it (I work from home). 

I have now lost ~24 lbs over the last 3 months, making only minor changes: 

• Low-impact exercise 20-30 min, 3-5 times a week, usually walking. 

• Light strength training, 20-30 minutes, 3 times a week. Resistance bands, body weight, dumbbells. 

• Increased protein intake and an overall healthy diet with a slight caloric deficit. I aim for a daily 80-100g of protein right now, but will probably try to increase.

• Staying hydrated - Game changer! I'm the type of person who has to remind myself of basic things like eating and drinking, and I think it has to do with the fibro and that trying to ignore the pain has made me surpress thirst and hunger as well. I felt a huge difference within the first few days. 

• Taking supplements. I'm not the right person to give advice on this, so I consulted a professional and suggest everyone does to find what's right for them. 

• Sleep hygiene - aiming for 7 hours. No screen before bedtime, no caffeine after 4pm.

• Staying consistent, but not beating myself up if I miss my daily goals one day. 

I have much more energy and overall the above changes have led to a significant improvement in my fibromyalgia/brain fog. 

(English isn't my first language, so I apologize for any grammar errors and if something doesn’t make 100% sense)",general fitness
"I do not have the chronic conditions but I started similarly.

I will say for me atleast the walking did not help. It helped with my mental health part a bit. Such as stress. But same time didn't help my lonelier. Seperate issue.


I'm older by a bit. I started at 260. But I went to the gym and did whatever machine was comfortable to me. I had body issues. I started doing the elliptical since it was easier on my knees. I would pick machines that worked muscle groups by day and what was free. You'll learn what muscle groups the machines have pictures. Then gradually you transition to more intense machines or free weights when your comfortable.


Since you said you have weights at home. I'd look up workouts at home. Something that incorporates more body weight type exercises. You can do a easy circuit. There's nothing wrong with not liking a workout. Just do it till you find one you like. Consistency is the issue. Just working up to making it part of your life.


The food thing has always been an issue with me. The transition to better food and understanding calories for food is the mindset you should aim for. Don't starve yourself. But realize things they satisfy a craving that have a better caloric value. Example I want salty, I do a 100 calorie bag of Costco popcorn.


Good luck!",general fitness
"Same! And I don’t socialize out at bars nearly as much, which was a problem for me when it came to weight loss.",general fitness

"Amazing and inspiring! Congrats and thank you for sharing :). I'm halfway to my GW of 140 and feel like it is so much easier than it was in the beginning too! I think with a slow and steady approach, some things become second nature and thus require less brainspace. Stories like yours have helped nail down that the slow and steady approach is the best way to make lasting changes. Way to go!",general fitness
"Congratulations! 40 pounds is a lot of work, and more importantly, a lot of consistency!

I’m really happy for you that you were able to change your habits to accomplish your goals! Good luck on getting down those last few pounds before the holidays, too!",general fitness
"Thank you!! It really is easier. My GW was 145, and it would have been so simple to say, “Well, I made it! Time to stop!” Especially because I’m not unhappy with how I look and feel now. But especially near the end, it has been so sustainable and easy to be honest, that I figure I might as well keep going to 135 while I’m at it. Once you build the habits, you’ve done the hard work! Sure, the scale doesn’t move as quickly, but you see the body changes so much more.",general fitness
Thank you for your message! It is very kind. I have to agree about slow and steady being the most sustainable method. Congrats on being halfway to your goal weight!!,general fitness
I appreciate it! Congrats on the 40 lbs yourself! :),general fitness
"Mental load is a big thing. Coaches benefit from having coaches. Having someone else write your program results in a lower likelihood that you’ll neglect areas you don’t ‘enjoy’ as much in training and lifestyle; it gives constant accountability. 

Furthermore, coaches notice things you won’t notice in yourself. Even the most experienced bodybuilders and powerlifters have blind spots in their own training. A second eye is always helpful.

Also, they provide support - emotional, mental AND physical. Prep is hard. A team behind you is so bloody valuable",general fitness
"We recognize that even though we may be born with good genetics that doesn’t mean we know everything about pharmacology, nutrition and training. To be quite honest most dont have the time or some are so gifted they never have to try to find what works because everything works",general fitness
"Richest people in the world have financial advisors. Best athletes have nutrition, sports and physical trainers. Best racecar drivers have mechanics and assistant drivers. Best mountain hikers hire local guides. If you think you know everything you know nothing, always good to have someone in your corner even if it’s just another pair of eyes.",general fitness

"The big mistake you are making here is thinking that the most important thing in bodybuilding is training. Training for adding size is actually pretty fool proof, there are many IFBB pros who trained like absolute idiots (or at least not ""optimally) yet built godlike physiques (Branch Warren for example).

But the drug protocols, especially during a contest prep aren't straightforward at all. This is where mostly a coach is needed.",general fitness
"Having a good coach is invaluable. Like others said, an objective second pair of eyes helps the athlete to simply execute without having to think too much about workouts, food, gear. Really good coaches know exactly whats needed and when for their athlete whether it’s food, training, rest, etc . They also provide emotional support and accountability and at that level are extremely knowledgeable. Also coaches tend to have connects whether it’s gear or people for injury rehab / prevention.

"I’ve been a coach for over ten years and still use another coach to do my programming. I do it for a few reasons. One is objectivity. They can sometimes see things about me and my weaknesses that I can’t. Because of this there isn’t any internal bias on their programming. Two, I don’t want the homework. I want to be able to show up and follow what my coach says and report back. I’m also not arrogant enough to think I know best. There’s always someone out there who knows more and that’s worth paying for.",general fitness
"also since no one mentioned, the coach really helps during comp prep when the athlete is severely depleted and not thinking 100% clearly, that peak week can kill",general fitness
Successful people always stay a student.,general fitness
"1 actual reason, objectivity.

Anyone that trains themselves, controls their own diet, looks at their own health markers, etc is likely/possibly going to fall victim to themselves and their own subjectivity.

"There is still value in having a 3rd party's opinion, even if you know everything there is to know about a topic. Most lawyers hire a lawyer if they end up being accussed of a crime.

"I imagine the same reason Magnus Carlsen had a chess coach throughout his reign.


Have a very strong expert in the field whose only job is to stay up with the latest theory and focus on the .1% of your package that can improve.


The best in the world aren't the best because they know the most. Maybe they don't even know a whole lot, because they are genetic freaks for whom it all came relatively easily.",general fitness
"You want someone watching you making sure your form is always locked in. Even the best athletes in the world in any sport can get a tiny bit too loose ever now again. Obviously they are pros for a reason, a vast majority of the time they get stuff right. But even cbum has a slightly sloppy rep once in awhile. 
Also allows them to push more and be more focused on the exercises themselves. They don't need to make a workout plan, they don't even need to count there own reps. They can just show up and focus on nothing else besides good reps and hard work. Also a coach will stay up to date on all the new scientific literature and implement new findings in the studies.",push pull legs
"There is multiple facets of this question to properly answer it.  Lets use CBum & Hany for the example

1 - Benefits of a trainer at that level is you just execute.   The athlete does not have to evaluate where they are lacking or can improve.  They also do not have to think about what movements to best attack those areas.  They simply execute what they are told because there is an inherent trust with that trainer.

2 - Reach a level of exertion that you cannot reach on your own.  Training to failure is one thing but force reps & beyond failure is not something you can train by yourself.  Without a partner or trainer, reaching that level of training is not simple.

3 - Its a partnership.  Do you think CBum is really paying Hany for his sessions?  Not at all.  Having an athlete like that brings Hany more business and makes Hany more valuable.  His training sessions are $350/hr because of the level of athletes he works with.  

4 - Coaching partnership.  When you have a coach and a separate trainer, there is collaboration between those two in terms of matching nutrition with output for optimal results.  Again, this is where it allows the athlete to just execute the plan.  The coach identifies what needs to be worked on and the trainer makes that the priority.

&#x200B;

As an athelete, when you dont have to think about what you are doing, it makes the process much easier.  For those that have been through multiple show preps, you know this.  When you can trust the process and just do what you are told, it makes the whole process more manageable.  If this didnt work, you wouldnt see top level athletes with trainers like Hany.   Just think about Hany's resume currently and in the past.   CBum, Derek Lunsford, Hadi Choopan, Jay Cutler, Phil Heath,  Jeremy Buendia",general fitness
"Bodybuilding is as much a mental contest as much as it is a physical one. Training is the easy part, dieting down and pushing your body as hard as you can while depleted of all nutrients and hydration is the hard part. Having a coach is having someone to focus on the numbers and watch your progress objectively while your mind is exhausted. They take a lot of the mental load off of an already mentally draining activity.

It's hard to analyze results objectively and adapt diet plans when you were up until 3am last night trying to resist the urge to run downstairs and make a peanut butter sandwich.",general fitness

Why do professional athletes need coaches?,general fitness
"In my experience it comes down to humans being emotional creatures. I have been training for 10+ years and had many friends turn to a good coach after years of training and suddenly making gains again.

Eventhough some people swear by it muscles are not best built by brute force. I wanna manage injuries, manage regenerative capacities smartly and make smart decisions. Meanwhile you are CBum trying to continue his reign as Mr Olympia imagine the pressure, it is easy to fall into your emotions and do things in training that seem like they make you excell but in the end just hurt you. It's about the details and outsourcing this mental effort to a coach and decoupling training decisions from your own emotions is what a good trainer offers a already top notch athlete.",general fitness

"Objectivity as well as the actual ability to prep someone. It’s not nearly as important in the offseason, I would say the most they do is help give suggestions on what body parts to prioritize and provide a little extra accountability to stay on whatever diet you’re doing. But people like Hany shine when it comes to prepping his clients. Managing water and sodium, keeping the diet at a pace where they won’t burn out while the person that is prepping might not be in the correct headspace to make those decisions him/her self. And then the closer to show do the more important a coach is to help you manage your stress and keep you on the correct plan.

Even if you know how to engage your chest with a press movement - you are pushing to the limit of exhaustion every single time. 

When you are at that level the trainer's job is only to make sure you keep the tension in the right places, help you recover and prevent you from injuring yourself. 

The regular reading of the blood work as well as diet and supplement tracking are also an important part of the job.",upper body
"CBum didn't do any courses to learn anything in depth about the body, exercises, supplements, gear, food/nutrition, etc..

"Having all the knowledge in the world doesn't make a trainer useless. 

A good trainer will hold you accountable and have a more objective view on how you are doing both in the gym and outside of it. 

Someone at the absolute top of the sport like CBum would likely push himself too hard if he had no leash, and he'd look worse on stage as a result. 
Also, things that are very obvious to you if someone else is doing them are less so if you are experiencing them yourself. 

And lastly, he's got enough stress and probably wants to spend as little time as possible on planning and analyzing everything. You're brain can't handle all that during prep.",push pull legs

The problem is that I came in very thick waisted and did not realize it until I saw my contest pics. I should have hired someone to at least take a look at me and work w/ my posing (which I did the last time I competed at age 32 and won my class at a big show). I should have trained lighter and worked more on reducing my midsection.

Now that I think about it, he's probably coaching the pros for free, and that's why they ""can afford"" having In-person sessions almost everyday (even though there is no money for low level bodybuilders without big socials)

Just my guess though, so do not take it as fact.",general fitness

"No. I don't think most of the top guys in any division pay their coaches. I'm fully aware that a coach taking on a top guy can also be a good business move for them. I'm not disputing that. But 1) if you're saying that by coaching Chris, Chris adds credibility to Hanys coaching, I'd argue Hany is the last coach in the industry that needed that, after his work with Phil, Jay, Derek, and Hadi. Or 2) if you're saying Chris adds credibility to his supplement brand, id argue that conventionally with sponsored athletes, when fans want to look like an athlete, they take the supplements that they take; which we know isn't Evogen supplements for Chris. 

I'm saying there might be *some* indirect benefits to Hany's businesses by coaching Chris (in a similar, but diminished, way that supplement companies benefit from sponsored athletes), calling Hany his sponsor is pretty misleading, given conventional meaning of the word.",general fitness

It’s actually funnier that someone so unaccomplished thinks they know more than the most successful coach in the industry. You’ll never be shit if you can’t accept that there will always be more than one way to get to point B.,general fitness
"All the top competitors got to where they were before Hany. Hany paid them because let’s be honest, bodybuilders are broke unless they’re in the top echelon. Hany’s brand grows, athletes get paid, everyone wins. The only benefit the athletes get from Hany, is money to fund their training.

"I'm not really sure I'd with that. Didn't Jay lose the title, then get with Hany and come back to win the title? Phil, while gifted, got with Hany before he ever stepped foot on the Olympia stage. He brought Derek up to the open class and within 2 years, won the Olympia. Yes, Hany has worked with the best, but he also brings out the best in his guys. He peaks his guys almost perfectly every single time his guys compete. Peaking is an art and can separate good coaches from the best coaches.",upper body
"Homeboy if you’re 6’0 215 I’m 15 pounds heavier at 2 inches shorter 😂 you’re small, you’ll probably always be small. I’m sure your “degree” keeps that ego nice and large. I’ve done over 10k in person sessions and every single person in bodybuilding would tell you my physique is better than yours (and I literally only follow any kind of structure in prep). You’re a joke. keep hiding those chicken legs and have a great afternoon",lower body
"Whoever wins Mr O can be subjective to the judges. Dexter beat Cuttler, but why? Cutler didn’t get any bigger or leaner in 09, 10. Derek beat Hadi, but by what measure? Hany definitely offers something as a “coach” but it’s not the knowledge of getting leaner or bigger, it’s by financial means because it’s good for his brand. He only aligns himself with the best because that’s what sells.",general fitness
"Highly doubt your 230 but by the looks of your belly not in prep u might be, short kings need love to it’s okay bro",general fitness
"I don't think the subjectivity of it refutes my point that he took Derek in 212 when he couldn't come in conditioned, and the first year he worked with Derek, he won the 212 Olympia, or how he then brought Derek up to open and within two years won the Olympia, or that he got with Phil at the beginning of his career and took him on to win 7 Olympias, or that he got Hadi an Olympia victory, or all of the Olympias he won with Jeremy in physique. 

If you haven't listened to Fouad's podcast, they talk about Hany frequently on there. He adds a lot as a coach and mentor, and per Fouad, knows exactly how to get the most out of his guys, moreso than the other coaches that he ever worked with. I just don't think, especially someone like Chris, or Jay, or Phil needs the financial means you're implying Hany provides. Those 3 of the wealthiest athletes in all of fitness. I just don't think that's the deciding factor.",general fitness
"Again, why did Lunsford beat Clarinda? My opinion is Shaun was better than the year before. Judging comes down to opinions of the judges. When big Ramy won his second title, he was in worse condition than the previous year. The coach at that level makes little difference. Hany offers the money and the environment to get the best out of themselves no doubt. He doesn’t have any secrets that hasn’t been common knowledge since DY changed the game. But again, our conversation here is subjective to opinion lol",general fitness

I looked into benching technique a bit more and realized that I had my back flat on the bench, which caused my front delts to protruded forward and also my barbell grip was pretty narrow. Flattening my back on the bench meant my front delt would protrude forward and take alot of the load. The narrow grip meant my triceps would take alot of the load. 

To correct this, I widen my grip a bit, puff my chest outwards. I found that pinching my shoulder blades together helped expand my chest outwards, which also helped to keep the front delts back and NOT protrude forward. Also flexing and keeping my pecs tense during the entire movement has done wonders for my development.

"I do competitive Irish dance which couldn’t be more different than Bharatanatyam, but I get what it’s like to try and match your exercise to a unique dance form!

One thing I take away from Bharatanatyam is the speed and precision you do certain moves in, specifically when your body is already in a fatiguing position. One thing I do for Irish dance is specifically incorporate a power/agility day. For power, you can do weight lifting moves you already do, but do the “work” part of the exercise explosively, and slow on the way back. Like a squat would slow on the way down, and as fast as you can on the way up.

My agility routine is very close to the moves I do in Irish dance so I don’t think it would translate, but I focus on basic moves and do them as fast as I can, focusing on how fast I can land, and pop back up.

I've been trying to get back into Bharatanatyam more seriously (it's a South Indian classical dance form). Here's a couple of clips of what it's like:  
[link1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CULHhYx0NRM&ab_channel=SrideviNrithyalaya)  (an excerpt from a varnam, which combines just pure steps with intervals of expressive acting)  
  
[link2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqoeyfbJXdo&ab_channel=SrideviNrithyalaya) (this is a thillana, which is the concluding piece of a performance that's only lively steps)  
  
So essentially a lot of leg strength, and good core stability and some upper body is necessary.  
  
In the past couple of years my workouts have been diverse. I did cross country for like a year, and now I've gotten into weightlifting for the past 4 months. I've kinda gained back a lot of weight that I want to lose too.  
  
Some suggestions on how you guys build a weekly routine as a dancer (especially as a busy student or with a job) would be great. I'm looking to practice dance often, but also weight train and maybe improve my cardiovascular endurance & flexibility.

"Hello!

Hey there! Balancing dance practice with weight training and cardio can be a fun challenge. Try mixing it up during the week. Spend one day perfecting your Bharatanatyam moves, then switch to upper body weights the next. Keep alternating between dance practice, strength training, and adding in some cardio and flexibility work. Listen to your body along the way and tweak your routine as needed. Just keep at it, stay patient, and enjoy the journey of getting stronger and more skilled!",general fitness
"That's really cool advice! I have never thought about incorporating an agility day. Irish dancing is also so incredible. 

I wanted to ask, do you have a strict schedule each week?",general fitness
"thank you for the tip! I'll check her videos out for sure. 

but about the classical dancer- I""M IN THE SAME BOAT OMG  literally i'm so glad I was able to learn the basics with one teacher for about 4-5 years and then literally every other teacher I've tried has quit.",general fitness
"I do have a pretty set schedule, which I’m happy to share!

Two times a week I do lower body focused resistance weight training. Once a week I do an upper body resistance weight training + core. Once a week I do a power/agility day. Once a week I do a stamina workout (typically a bike workout - I used to do sprints but not worth the wear and tear on my feet).

Take mine with a grain of salt - I’m 35 with two kids who works a desk job so not much other movement in my day. If you’re a busy student, a goal of three days a week might be more doable. A lower body strength, upper body strength + core, and conditioning may be a good start.  

Are there any established Bharatanatyam groups on your area you could check in with? The world of Irish dance is growing, and there are lots of great resources on Instagram for training for my particular sport. Perhaps there is for yours? Social media is generally terrible, but great for connecting on shared interests!",general fitness

"I would suggest a 2 day/week version of GZCLP or 5/3/1. Both are good programs for general strength. 

Also, I came across [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/@casparstadler7252/videos) a while back who focuses on strength training for ballet dancers. I feel like he used to have more content on his channel? But for a while he was cross-training as a dancer and powerlifter.",upper body

"I do ballet, albeit causally/recreationally and started as an adult. (I’m 27.) I also do aerial more seriously which has a lot of overlap with dance.

"Have you considered Olympic weightlifting? I'm not a dancer, but I used to be a competitive Thai boxer, and dynamic lifts, like power cleans, hanging snatches and push presses really helped develop explosive power. I imagine it would help a ballet dancer as well.

It takes a lot of practice and drilling technique before you can do them with heavier weights though.",push pull legs
"Ex-dancer turned powerlifter! Turns out my strong quads and glutes, that I used for ridiculous elevation in ballet, lend themselves really well to squats and deadlifts. Just be careful about form a plie =/= squat.  Deadlifts work well with flexible hammies but you have to be doubly careful about bracing. Rows will do wonders for a strong upper back :. Better posing/positioning. Check out some of the Royal Ballet dancers on Insta. They often post gym workouts.",lower body
Not sure if it's beneficial for you but when I used to dance I found that I really needed to work on explosiveness/power and I know that Abby Pollock has some workouts on that type of thing that would have helped me with my jumps and leaps.,general fitness

I do ballet (including pointe) 4-5 days a week and a progressing ballet technique (PBT) class once a week. PBT has increased my core strength and general body awareness significantly. I’m looking to add 1-2 (preferably full body) weightlifting workouts to my routine.

For context, I stopped dancing and I got into weightlifting on and off for about 5 years. While I enjoyed lifting 5 days a week, I burned out a bit and it just wasn’t my goal anymore and I got back into dance a few months ago.

I’ve followed various programs over the years, my favorite being Mark Carroll’s. My issue is I can’t find anything that would specifically complement dance/ballet and only 1-2x a week since I don’t want to overdo it. I could develop my own program but I’m not confident in my ability to target the best muscles. I’d prefer a free or one time payment program, not a coaching subscription. While Pilates reformer classes would be perfect, unfortunately it’s not in the budget. I prefer resistance training.

Any advice welcome, especially if you think this isn’t a good idea and have other suggestions. Thank you!

"Seconding Caroline. Her 6 week Iron series is good for strength and muscle building. Her 2 week Beastmode series is also great at that. Both lack explosive movements but have a really good amount of unilateral work, especially on legs. Her Epic series (plural) could be good. They mix in more cardio but have more explosive movements that would help for jumps.

I used to do cheer and wanted to keep my mobility, flexibility, balance, etc that I gained through there. For all the lunges and unilateral work, I use floor gliders. It gives me total control over the movement. I find the gliders help work all the smaller muscles needed for joint stability and balance a lot better. Great for knees, ankles, and hip stability. It also forces you to keep your alignment. When caroline lunges with bent legs, I keep mine straight so that I'm also working on weighted end-range to help with flexibility, mobility, and again, body control. I feel like the gliders with her program might be beneficial to your dance training and what you need for dance.

With Romanian dead lifts, I sometimes will do them on one leg to work on balance and using my core for stability. 


You don't have to keep up with her schedule/plan to see or feel results.

I don't find her workouts to target hip flexors as much as you might need for dance, but she is good for overall full body fitness and strength. I recently found Simone biles' core workout which looks to have a lot of core and hip flexor targeted exercises.",full body
"Hmm, that’s cool! I didn’t know they are similar. As an (mostly ex) dancer, I’d build a program around what you don’t get in the ballet class or need more of. For me, that would be cardio, ankle strength, quad strength, and glutes/rotators. For upper body, I have nothing, so any standard upper body work would help. 

I’m sorry - I know that’s not really what you asked for. I’m sure there’s some pro ballerinas out there that have put out their cross train routine, or id also search for “sports medicine physical therapy ballet” and see if some combo of that gives you some results.",lower body

This is a *really* good suggestion. I know my PT does consults with people in all kinds of sports and helps them design complementary programs that will help their performance.

"No worries, your advice is helpful. I’m nervous to build my own program if there’s something out there offering more expertise. With so many different exercises, it’s hard to know which are more optimal. I’ve also heard it’s not always smart to build your own program.

As for upper body, rear delts and lats are foundational to arm placement, so I’d definitely incorporate that.

I’ve scoured online and most of the professional ballet workouts are Pilates reformers or bodyweight. I imagine on a professional schedule they don’t have as much cross training as they do injury prevention or physical therapy.",upper body

I tell ya in 5 months we get to hear about time under tension from everyone again.


Building muscle isn't complicated but bodybuilding is a competitive sport, you need to lift optimally and if some way to structure your training is 5% better than everything else then you should do that. Building muscle is a slow process, if you don't lift optimally it's even slower, why waste time. If your genes are bad you have to work optimally to even get acceptable results, or else you stop lifting. I think there is much more than just those general guidelines. In the future we will see more iso work, more machines, more partial reps, more drop sets, more periodisation, more focus on muscles you didn't know existed/you should train.",general fitness

Yes. I think it's important that people understand that dudes on the internet overwhelmingly uses ""bodybuilding"" to mean ""getting jacked"" in the same way they use ""powerlifting"" to mean ""getting strong"" and is rarely in either case actually talking about competing in the sport. Like, r/bodybuilding's 2019 survey showed overwhelmingly that the barest possible minimum of their users intend to compete, and even fewer *actually* compete.

>Conclusion: Lower Body. These studies support the
hypothesis that a large percentage of an individu-
al’s muscle growth potential will likely be achieved
within the first 3 months (12 weeks) of training. It
seems unlikely that individuals will increase their
muscle mass by appreciable amounts beyond what
is gained by the time of plateau. However, most of
these studies were performed for durations of 6–12
weeks; a longer study duration would be required
to test this hypothesis. In an older population, it
may take longer for muscle growth to occur and
plateau, although some of this may be related to
this population requiring a greater exercise vol-
ume for a given response within a training ses-
sion.18 For example, a recent article found no age-
related differences in how muscle size changed
across time.37 This lack of age effect is likely due
to the accumulated volume from doing multiple
sets of exercise on multiple different exercises tar-
geting similar muscle groups in the lower body.
Furthermore, in a trained population, similar to
the upper body, muscle growth did not occur.38 In
conclusion, statistically significant increases in ante-
rior upper leg muscle size from baseline are likely
to occur within the first month of training, with a
potential plateau 4–6 weeks after the initial statisti-
cal increase in baseline muscle size. In addition,
the population studied (elderly, trained, etc.) can
result in a prolonged or limited response to resis-
tance training.",lower body
