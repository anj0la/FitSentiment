"I use mynetdiary. All of the logging / weight tracking is free currently, but there is a subscription option for things like autopilot calories and recipe saving."
"FatSecret still has a free scanner. I ran FatSecret and cronometer simultaneously for a week or so, and I landed on FatSecret for myself. I miss the old mfp before shareholder and corporate greed took over."
I love cronometer.  I use the paid version but used the free for a while before I upgraded.  I love that they use the NCCDB calorie counts and doesn't rely on some people's custom counts.  I've literally seen a bacon guacamole burger from Red Robin listed as 400kcals on MFP and it was someone's custom entry.  That doesn't happen on Cronometer that I've seen.
"I‚Äôve been in this sub for years and this post made me realize it‚Äôs not a sub for people who use the lose it app 

I use the lose it app, it‚Äôs not the best but it‚Äôs easy to use and I lost 90 pounds with it. I‚Äôve used it on and off for 10 years and have never paid a dime. I always eat back my calories from exercise. It‚Äôs my little ‚Äúreward‚Äù for exercising that day. The lose it app automatically loads my exercise calories from my Apple Watch."
"Chronometer completely redid the front-end of their website and app and it is so much better than it was previously IMO. That being said, I paid for lifetime loseit premium and like it a lot as well."
"If you aren't paying for it, either you are the product, or they are trying to drive you to pay for it.  Meaning they will withhold features to the paid tier, and the paid tiers will actually be subsidizing the free users.  MFP is expensive because the paid users have to support all the free users + be profitable.

I found lose it premium to be worth it for the price, affordable and good for what you get. I use MacroFactor now, which has a fair price and no free tier, so they develop the app to be the best for everyone that uses it."
"Myfitnesspal UI was my favorite of all the free calorie apps. 

Really hated using loseit/cronometer/etc.

MFP was the fastest to categorize, input meals, search for ingredients, and swap quickly between cups/spoons and ounces/pounds/grams.  I also liked the recipe feature for meal prepping.

However, I don't count calories anymore."
I use myfitnesspal but switched the region to United Kingdom and that made the scanner free again.
lifesum
New here but yazio looks super promising got all the juicy free stuff
"I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm losing my mind but I can‚Äôt find it in my App Store

Edit: just kidding! It‚Äôs called calorie counter by cronometer! Thank you for this, I‚Äôve been hoping to find a new one since my fitness pal took away the barcode scanner as a free option"
Second for loseit! The way they divide up calories per meal has been so helpful. And better user interface than MFP.
Also use lose it. Some time ago I was offered a lifetime subscription for $100 and snagged that up. Totally worth it.
Currently like this app over lose it. Love the apple visuals üçè
"I pay for premium too! It's been very helpful. Also, if you have taken a dna test (myancestry for example) you can upload it to lose it and it helps curate your goals based on genetic markers!"
"Do not bring political topics or discussion into /r/loseit 

Stay on topic of OPs weight journey, the pictures, or the original poster's comments. Keep political debate to other subreddits regardless of your intention. Do not derail conversation."
"I used to use lose it, redownloaded and it is not free... :("
"I've been using lifesum now for 3 months. Its hands down my favorite free app, and you can scan bar codes.¬†"
cronometer for sure. best macro and nutrient tracking out there.
lose it is the best!!
+2 lose it
Looove my net diary!
"i use the lose it! app.  it gets data from iphone's 'health' and 'fitness' apps, plus data from my wyze digital scale.  i have created in-app recipes for homemade stuff like tuna salad, beef stew, etc so i can get the real nutrition info, plus the app has info for a gazillion ingredients and restaurant foods.

there are more good features, but i already sound like an advertiser.

i track calories, exercise, fasting times, macro nutrients.

"I like FatSecret. Terrible name but for macro breakdown, I thought it was better than mfp because I am mainly tracking protein and carb intake"
"I use Macros first- been using it for two years and it‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôve stuck with. I tried zero, lose it, mfp‚Ä¶ for some reason it just clicks with me"
"I use cronometer. If you want a free website to do so, check https://foodstruct.com.
Make sure to select correct description of food. For example 50g raw chickpea, is 150g after cooking but both have the same calories."
I use cronometer and it is really nice!
"I use lose it, it's not perfect but it works."
"I really like carb manager. It has the best variety or foods and measurement options. I used cronometer when I first started counting and was interested in nutrition because it breaks down your vitamins and all that, but it has less food items then carb manager.ir also has a pie chart of your macros"
Lots of people use myfitnesspal but it relies on crowdsourced data and so can be inaccurate sometimes. It‚Äôs the Wikipedia of calorie counting apps. Chronometer doesn‚Äôt have this problem but I believe does not have as extensive list of foods because of this.
I am using my macros+ but a personal trainer that I was going to use did recommend the cronometer app too.
"I love myfitnesspal. It know almost all the foods (even though I live in Belgium). I first started out with the fitbit app (because I have a fitbit), but it was so insufficient and I had to add almost all the foods myself. Myfitnesspal is really the way to go. 

Though, you should pay attention when adding something that it is correct. Users can add stuff without someone checking if it is correct so sometimes I find foods that are entered falsly. Luckily it is very easy to alter them :) 

What I like most is that I can say I want to eat the same breakfast as yesterday. So everything is added at once but I can alter it if something changed today.
(I eat yoghurt with muesli and fruit. The fruit changes a lot and the amount of muesli, so pretty nice to be able to pick yesterday's breakfast and just make small alterations)"
"I use myfitnesspal, You can just scan the products for the nutrition info and I can even save my own meals and recipes for later use. This is just great in combination with mealprepping."
"Ive used myfitnesspal for the past 4 years, logging in every single day. Unfortunately the ease of use doesnt make up for all the bugs and how expensive premium is. If they lowered the cost of premium and fixed some problems i wouldnt mind sticking with it but for now i stick with chronometer"
"A dedicated loseit user since 2014 - I find it to be more customizable  than MFP. And if you email them, you can get half off premium."
"Does it have a lot of items from the store, and the specific brands like MyFitnessPal does? I know Cronometer has much more info about the nutrition that‚Äôs why I consider switching but MFP is just so convenient wir the ability to scan products. Can I do that on cronometer too?"
"been using mfp for like 8 years and have never once needed premium, js."
"Everything. It has the same database.

Recipes are easier to make

You can copy certain meals or full days

It's a COACH. You choose a goal, fat loss, gain, maintenance, reverse diet. Check in weekly and it literally changes your macros and tells if you have gained or lost too much.. Also takes into account if you are close to menstrual cycle. It also asks what rate. So right now I've been in a 6m surplus gaining 0.3kg per week. If i lose, it ups my cals, gain too much, decreases.

You can also have higher days and lower days. I tell it i want weekend higher days, so it changes the rest of the week to account for this.

Its 100 times whar mfp is. Including the premium."
"I usually still plan ahead on loseit. After breakfast, I usually input what I plan to have for dinner so I can see how many calories I can consume during the day"
"They have said they don't do free trials because of how little it's priced anyway. 

To me, it's well worth the money- especially if you can't afford a coach.

10 pound a month is a steal for what you get  tops mfp by a mile!"
