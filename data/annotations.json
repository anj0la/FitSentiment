    ["\"I personally use myfitnesspal, it’s the easiest free app for me and lets you pick your own intake limit meanwhile a lot of other ones don’t let you go below 1200 or pick it for you. I really loved nutra check because it was my favourite and easiest calorie counting app and had all kinds of features like barcode scanning and custom amounts of foods but the free trial eventually ran out and after that it limits you to 5 food logs a day so I went back to MFP\" \"LoseIt, Myfitnesspal, Cronometer take your pick based on personal preference. Personally I use loseit with a free account and just manually add when the barcode scanner doesn’t pick up or isn’t accurate. Ads get annoying but that’s just how it goes for free users.\" \"After myfitnesspal started charging to use the barcode feature, I switched to macrosfirst and I've been satisfied with it\" yazio is my fav yazio !! i like it tbh dont use mfp lose it is sm better I second my net diary! I'm currently using the premium because it was on offer for £11 a year so I thought I'd give it a go but I was perfectly happy with the free version too and had no issues using it. I'll be going back to the free version at the end of the year if there's not another offer on for premium as I don't think it's worth full price. Back to check out what other apps there are. Was fascinated by cronometer till I saw that they don't have Chinese food. Mfp has a wide database and it suits my local food culture better. OP should try out everything to see which suits them better too💪 \"I’ve tried both, I like lose it.\" I find loseit pretty good for Chinese food too! I think it has a good sized user database. I just added some lamb soup noodles yesterday and chili oil marinated chicken recently so it's more than just American Chinese food. I will forever be a fan of cronometer but I've heard a lot of good things about macrofactor. They cost money but it's less expensive than a lot of premium subscriptions to other tracking apps I use myfitnesspal and I've lost around 4 kgs in the past 2 months (just started calorie counting 1 month ago). Most people recommend it - doesn't have disruptive ads or any distracting content. I use mynetdiary. Im down 18 pounds in 88 days and its free with no ads I've been using mynetdiary and I've liked it so far. Just doing the free version because the premium stuff isn't really necessary. I'll take a look at the loseit app. Thanks! \"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calorie-counter-mynetdiary/id287529757 MyNet Diary, this one is probably the best I’ve used by far👍🏽\" For what it's worth I just downloaded and tried all 3 and I prefer Cronometer - much simpler than myfitnesspal without as many gimmicky features I don't need. Hi there! Our sincerest apologies for any issues you're experiencing with MyFitnessPal. Our team is always happy to assist! Please send an email to [support@myfitnesspal.com](mailto:support@myfitnesspal.com) for further help. Thank you! \"I think most, if not all calorie trackers would be good for weight gain. The one I use is cronometer, which let's you set your desired weight gained per week. Cronometer also let's you see the macro or micronutrients you might be missing in the free version. I've heard only good things about macrofactor, but it does cost money (still less expensive than MyFitnessPal premium I believe)\" Thank you! Just created my cronometer account \"myfitnesspal does! not many people know how to use this feature but if you go to more > settings > sharing & privacy > diary sharing > and set to friends only or public...you should be able to go to more > friends > click profile > and click diary icon hope this helps :)\" i use lifesum I like mfp and the abrcode thing still works for me.(I know many dont like mfp tho) i like mynetdiary. i’ve tried a couple different ones including fatsecret and i like the configuration of netdiary best. you can customize it a lot which is nice and it’s visually pleasing. I highly recommend [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/)! cronometer i used yazio and mynetdiary and they are both pretty good \"my fitness pal or lose it, imo especially if you’re outside the usa. both have crowdsourced info from users, so if you eat a lot of foods that are uncommon in western countries, these usually have at least some input in them! ofc you will need to doublecheck if it looks accurate etc.\" \"lose it is great, there’s also mynetdiary\" \"[https://cronometer.com/](https://cronometer.com/) still has a free version with a lot of features (macro tracking, bar code scanner, etc).\" I use lifesum. Has a barcode scanner for free too \"Free Loseit has all of the features you need. But for $20 for a year… loseits premium features are nice and decently affordable. Tracking macros, nutritions strategies, planning meals days ahead, etc\" \"i dont think lose it does that, but if u go over ur limit im pretty sure theres a bit of red on the bar\" Is loseit! superior to MyFitnessPal?

I don't let it calculate my calorie needs based on my exercise; I tell it what my daily calorie goal is.

Because it allows user created entries, I usually double check against product packaging or USDA website and edit or create my own entries when necessary. Other options are [Chronometer](https://cronometer.com/) and [LoseIt](https://www.loseit.com/). The specific app is less important than figuring out your [TDEE or maintenance calories](https://tdeecalculator.net/), and tracking well enough to be reasonably sure you're eating less than that on average each day. As long as you eat less than your TDEE more days than not, you'll lose weight. Good luck!\" \"This is such a great start, and love thinking about this reverse.

My guess would be that most of the big players have that. \"Tbh tracking Indian food is a bit hard since everyone makes the dishes differently - I'm guju but I put way less sugar in my dal than many of my friends who are guju I typically like to use cronometer and create personal recipes in there for tracking kcals\" \"I like **cronometer**, t",{"entities":[[0,10,"B-APP"],[17,23,"B-FEATURE"],[28,32,"B-FEATURE"],[33,38,"I-FEATURE"],[43,47,"B-FEATURE"],[48,56,"I-FEATURE"],[110,123,"B-APP"],[156,164,"B-FEATURE"],[257,262,"B-FEATURE"],[267,274,"B-FEATURE"],[516,520,"B-APP"],[526,538,"B-APP"],[542,552,"B-APP"],[583,589,"B-FEATURE"],[617,625,"B-FEATURE"],[641,652,"B-APP"],[669,673,"B-FEATURE"],[684,691,"I-FEATURE"],[729,738,"B-FEATURE"],[796,803,"B-FEATURE"],[811,814,"B-APP"],[870,873,"B-APP"],[897,905,"B-FEATURE"],[984,991,"B-FEATURE"],[1056,1063,"B-FEATURE"],[1112,1120,"B-FEATURE"],[1126,1129,"B-APP"],[1219,1230,"B-APP"],[1307,1310,"B-APP"],[1373,1381,"B-FEATURE"],[1404,1412,"B-FEATURE"],[1419,1424,"I-FEATURE"],[1458,1462,"B-APP"],[1487,1499,"B-APP"],[1515,1522,"B-FEATURE"],[1523,1529,"I-FEATURE"],[1559,1566,"B-FEATURE"],[1744,1748,"B-APP"],[1769,1776,"B-FEATURE"],[1790,1797,"I-FEATURE"],[1848,1860,"B-APP"],[1873,1881,"B-FEATURE"],[1892,1896,"B-APP"],[1920,1928,"B-FEATURE"],[1932,1938,"B-FEATURE"],[1942,1956,"B-FEATURE"],[1965,1969,"B-FEATURE"],[1970,1978,"I-FEATURE"],[1990,1995,"B-APP"],[2003,2016,"B-APP"],[2026,2029,"B-APP"],[2094,2099,"B-FEATURE"],[2100,2105,"B-FEATURE"],[2107,2110,"B-FEATURE"],[2112,2119,"B-FEATURE"],[2121,2126,"B-FEATURE"],[2128,2134,"B-FEATURE"],[2151,2160,"B-FEATURE"],[2201,2209,"B-FEATURE"],[2210,2213,"I-FEATURE"],[2234,2242,"B-FEATURE"],[2302,2318,"B-FEATURE"],[2338,2354,"B-APP"],[2355,2358,"I-APP"],[2387,2394,"B-FEATURE"],[2395,2402,"I-FEATURE"],[2403,2406,"B-APP"],[2410,2423,"B-APP"],[2460,2463,"B-FEATURE"],[2469,2477,"I-FEATURE"],[2498,2505,"B-FEATURE"],[2506,2513,"I-FEATURE"],[2583,2597,"B-APP"],[2702,2716,"B-FEATURE"],[2722,2726,"B-FEATURE"],[2752,2766,"B-APP"],[2840,2854,"B-APP"],[2863,2866,"B-FEATURE"],[2876,2881,"I-FEATURE"],[2889,2902,"B-APP"],[2955,2959,"B-APP"],[3153,3156,"B-APP"],[3162,3172,"B-FEATURE"],[3173,3180,"I-FEATURE"],[3200,3203,"B-APP"],[3312,3318,"B-FEATURE"],[3343,3346,"B-FEATURE"],[3347,3352,"I-FEATURE"],[3361,3367,"B-APP"],[3427,3430,"B-APP"],[3573,3580,"B-FEATURE"],[3617,3624,"B-FEATURE"],[3625,3633,"I-FEATURE"],[3653,3658,"B-FEATURE"],[3666,3671,"I-FEATURE"],[3743,3753,"B-FEATURE"],[3772,3784,"B-APP"],[3845,3851,"B-FEATURE"],[3875,3881,"B-FEATURE"],[3977,4003,"B-FEATURE"],[4056,4069,"B-APP"],[4095,4103,"B-FEATURE"],[4104,4114,"B-APP"],[4130,4135,"B-FEATURE"],[4140,4148,"I-FEATURE"],[4149,4157,"I-FEATURE"],[4169,4173,"B-APP"],[4174,4176,"I-APP"],[4194,4198,"B-APP"],[4199,4201,"I-APP"],[4209,4211,"B-APP"],[4212,4215,"I-APP"],[4216,4221,"I-APP"],[4229,4235,"B-APP"],[4260,4270,"B-APP"],[4287,4297,"B-APP"],[4311,4322,"B-APP"],[4327,4331,"B-FEATURE"],[4332,4339,"I-FEATURE"],[4344,4352,"B-FEATURE"],[4377,4387,"B-FEATURE"],[4405,4409,"B-APP"],[4415,4421,"B-APP"],[4483,4487,"B-APP"],[4488,4490,"I-APP"],[4616,4628,"B-APP"],[4641,4649,"B-FEATURE"],[4650,4657,"I-FEATURE"],[4721,4729,"B-FEATURE"],[4907,4917,"B-APP"],[4938,4945,"B-FEATURE"],[4959,4967,"B-FEATURE"],[4983,4997,"B-APP"]]}],
    ["he free options are great and nothing necessary is behind a paywall. A lot of people use **lose it**, I use lose it whenever I don't have Internet for an extended period of time because it has a pretty good offline database. I prefer to use cronometer because I feel like it has a lot of free options that lose it makes you pay for.\" I use mynetdiary. No ads but it will prompt to join their subscription every so often. Has a lot of foods already in their catalog which is super helpful! \"I really like mynetdiary, but I don't like how they calculate how many calories you need to lose x pounds per week. I use cronometer to calculate my calories and enter that number into mynetdiary I think it's my favorite calorie counting app I've ever used, even compared to lose it before they made their barcode scanner premium\" \"The short version is that they use a different equation than the tdee calculator that this sub recommends. I like to use the sedentary option for my tdee at maintenance, and for the cico sub determination, that comes out to 2405, but mynetdiary's comes out to 2901. It's a huge difference, and I maintain at 2405 and gain very quickly at 2900\" My barcode scanner on my net diary along with my food scale makes it SO easy.

I used to use the my fitness pal premium but I recently switched toto lose it premium. I have it connected to my watch. I like both apps but so far I’m finding I like the lose it app better. I hope you find what works the best for you. They are both good apps. \"Just started using lose it, and it seems pretty good, but I've been using my macros + for years and it's great.\" Don't pay for a calorie tracker. You can get what you need for free. One example is cronometer I use loseit \"I like lose it It’s very intuitive\" yazio :) I use lose it and just search for the item by name. they are usually in there and you don't have to use the barcode. \"Bar code scans have been off. It happens too frequently for me to see the barcode element as a \"\"feature\"\". I take a picture of food item or ingredient on a scale and end up at the end of the day. I also pre- plan my meals by 1-4 weeks. I source my calorie info from current packaging or looking up the food item via google USDA's info. If I forget to take a picture I just write down what it was and the grams in my notepad app. I only use the apps if I am reviewing my macros or building a new meal/recipe or dish anymore. I use MyFitnessPal but always find errors in food. I keep meaning to download cronometer or loseit and replace myfitnesspal but just havent. Sitting down once a month and preplanning meals made me really not give a floop about apps. It is good as a learning tool, but not really needed for the long run once you get your new habits sorted.\" \"I bought a lifetime to lose it which is basically free if you use it for the next 40 years but yeah chronometer is the only one left with barcode scanning free, and I suspect even they will fall soon\" \"I use Cronometer, the free version has everything you need to get you started and it's very user friendly. Every food in their database is correct as everything on there is pre approved as opposed to myfitnesspal for example where you will find a million entries for the same food by different users, often wrong so you need to double check everything.\" I nearly blew a gasket building a recipe min the lose it app. I know it can be done but I got super frustrated and gave up!

It gives a breakdown for every nutrient.\" I use loseit because I got a trial and it worked for me. If this app didn’t work mfp is my next one to try. I tried weight watchers but it didn’t work well for me. My fitness pal for me but lose it seemed just as good. I just started with MFP so stuck with it. Do you pay on lose it or is it free? \"Nah, doesn't loseit not even track protein grams? I was stunned to learn that last week. Sure, not everyone cares how much calcium or folate they get, but no protein?\" \"Yes, you can track all macros for free on lose it. You can track daily protein, carbs and fats, swipe left on calorie tab You can also track all macros per meal if you click on the title of each meal, “breakfast” “lunch” and “dinner”… I think a lot of people don’t realize this, too.\" \"In my opinion, there isn't anything out there better than MacroFactor. Devs are active on reddit in r/macrofactor and there's regular updates and improvements to the app. It takes an adherence neutral approach and calculates your expenditure to an absurd level of accuracy. Largest RD verified database and stuff like AI describe where you literally talk your recipe to the app and it autocreates the recipe. You can also copy and paste recipes from the Internet into it as well. I've lost 15kg with it. Genuine game changer. Its paid but worth every since penny\" \"Can't go past cronometer. Every item is staff screened, has an option for grams, and they have impressive vitamin and mineral tracking/breakdown.\" \"I like when the data is hidden away and I can get reports. Like, on cronometer it's easy to enter stuff, but I can tap through to see nutrient reports and breakdowns of them.\" \"i used loseit and while it is a little annoying, just like anything once you make a habit of utilizing it while cooking and weighing it really becomes second nature. Keep at it!\" Congrats to the amazing progress! I hope you’re feeling better and your injury is healing! The link to your yazio thing wasn’t working unfortunately 🫠 I use the same app ☺️ \"Thanks a lot! I'm on week 2 of physiotherapy and beginning to start walking outside again! For what regards running doctors told me to wait a couple of months and do low impact exercises instead 💪🏽 Gosh! I thought the link was the same as 2 weeks ago, this should work! https://to.yazio.com/pH951\" I love lose it! They have more measurement units and overall its extremely user friendly I paid for lose it premium for a year and switched back to MFP. Lose it is pretty but I just prefer MFP for some reason Thank you 🙂 so you found lose it to have a prettier interface but MFP just became habit \"Thank you, I'm in the position and was wondering if I should make the shift but also the faff around disconnecting apps and reconnecting to lose it\" I use fat secret. It’s free and pretty decent:) happy counting! Cheers I like loseit. \"Yes, cronometer is orders of magnitude better. All the entries are correct, and they all offer grams. Your TDEE is about 2500, so yeah, 2250 is a bit high. Did you tell it you were exercising? Your BMR is 2200 even if you are 18, so whatever you are entering into sites is wrong.\" I use yazio. I'm from Germany and they have a pretty big data bank of german products that I couldn't find with other apps. So depending on where you're from this could be helpful i also use loseit but the free version and can confirm the barcode scanner is free :) I use cronometer everyday. I have my Fitbit linked to it. Just input every calorie and I set it to lose 1.5 pounds a week. I just eat exactly what it tells me I can and I actually lose 1.5 a week. It’s really cool \"I've tried my fitness pal, lose it, and chronometer and I always come back to my fitness pal. I find it the simplest to use. Others have fancier interfaces but there's just a lot more going on that I either don't need or just make navigating around more confusing. I also didn't like that lose it makes you pay for premium in order to connect to a fitness tracker. That may or may not be relevant to you, but there's that.\" \"I am extremely happy with https://www.fatsecret.com/ for many years now. Nearly everything you need is free, just pre-made recipes, water tracking and meal plans and so on are behind a Premium subscription (you can of course still pre-log and make your own recipes and use user made recipes).\" \"So I went through a phase about three months ago when my premium subscription of myfitnesspal expired where I tried all the main ones (lose it, cronometer, macrofactor, etc.). I ultimately settled with lose it and purchased a lifetime sub for $60 after one month of their normal month to month subscription. Loseit has all the features you really need (scanner, macros, large food database) but the main reason I liked it is that it can scan labels and autofill nutrient information.
