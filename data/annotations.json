    ["\"I personally use myfitnesspal, it’s the easiest free app for me and lets you pick your own intake limit meanwhile a lot of other ones don’t let you go below 1200 or pick it for you. I really loved nutra check because it was my favourite and easiest calorie counting app and had all kinds of features like barcode scanning and custom amounts of foods but the free trial eventually ran out and after that it limits you to 5 food logs a day so I went back to MFP\" \"LoseIt, Myfitnesspal, Cronometer take your pick based on personal preference. Personally I use loseit with a free account and just manually add when the barcode scanner doesn’t pick up or isn’t accurate. Ads get annoying but that’s just how it goes for free users.\" \"After myfitnesspal started charging to use the barcode feature, I switched to macrosfirst and I've been satisfied with it\" yazio is my fav yazio !! i like it tbh dont use mfp lose it is sm better I second my net diary! I'm currently using the premium because it was on offer for £11 a year so I thought I'd give it a go but I was perfectly happy with the free version too and had no issues using it. I'll be going back to the free version at the end of the year if there's not another offer on for premium as I don't think it's worth full price. Back to check out what other apps there are. Was fascinated by cronometer till I saw that they don't have Chinese food. Mfp has a wide database and it suits my local food culture better. OP should try out everything to see which suits them better too💪 \"I’ve tried both, I like lose it.\" I find loseit pretty good for Chinese food too! I think it has a good sized user database. I just added some lamb soup noodles yesterday and chili oil marinated chicken recently so it's more than just American Chinese food. I will forever be a fan of cronometer but I've heard a lot of good things about macrofactor. They cost money but it's less expensive than a lot of premium subscriptions to other tracking apps I use myfitnesspal and I've lost around 4 kgs in the past 2 months (just started calorie counting 1 month ago). Most people recommend it - doesn't have disruptive ads or any distracting content. I use mynetdiary. Im down 18 pounds in 88 days and its free with no ads I've been using mynetdiary and I've liked it so far. Just doing the free version because the premium stuff isn't really necessary. I'll take a look at the loseit app. Thanks! \"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calorie-counter-mynetdiary/id287529757 MyNet Diary, this one is probably the best I’ve used by far👍🏽\" For what it's worth I just downloaded and tried all 3 and I prefer Cronometer - much simpler than myfitnesspal without as many gimmicky features I don't need. Hi there! Our sincerest apologies for any issues you're experiencing with MyFitnessPal. Our team is always happy to assist! Please send an email to [support@myfitnesspal.com](mailto:support@myfitnesspal.com) for further help. Thank you! \"I think most, if not all calorie trackers would be good for weight gain. The one I use is cronometer, which let's you set your desired weight gained per week. Cronometer also let's you see the macro or micronutrients you might be missing in the free version. I've heard only good things about macrofactor, but it does cost money (still less expensive than MyFitnessPal premium I believe)\" Thank you! Just created my cronometer account \"myfitnesspal does! not many people know how to use this feature but if you go to more > settings > sharing & privacy > diary sharing > and set to friends only or public...you should be able to go to more > friends > click profile > and click diary icon hope this helps :)\" i use lifesum I like mfp and the abrcode thing still works for me.(I know many dont like mfp tho) i like mynetdiary. i’ve tried a couple different ones including fatsecret and i like the configuration of netdiary best. you can customize it a lot which is nice and it’s visually pleasing. I highly recommend [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/)! cronometer i used yazio and mynetdiary and they are both pretty good \"my fitness pal or lose it, imo especially if you’re outside the usa. both have crowdsourced info from users, so if you eat a lot of foods that are uncommon in western countries, these usually have at least some input in them! ofc you will need to doublecheck if it looks accurate etc.\" \"lose it is great, there’s also mynetdiary\" \"[https://cronometer.com/](https://cronometer.com/) still has a free version with a lot of features (macro tracking, bar code scanner, etc).\" I use lifesum. Has a barcode scanner for free too \"Free Loseit has all of the features you need. But for $20 for a year… loseits premium features are nice and decently affordable. Tracking macros, nutritions strategies, planning meals days ahead, etc\" \"i dont think lose it does that, but if u go over ur limit im pretty sure theres a bit of red on the bar\" Is loseit! superior to MyFitnessPal?

I don't let it calculate my calorie needs based on my exercise; I tell it what my daily calorie goal is.

Because it allows user created entries, I usually double check against product packaging or USDA website and edit or create my own entries when necessary. Other options are [Chronometer](https://cronometer.com/) and [LoseIt](https://www.loseit.com/). The specific app is less important than figuring out your [TDEE or maintenance calories](https://tdeecalculator.net/), and tracking well enough to be reasonably sure you're eating less than that on average each day. As long as you eat less than your TDEE more days than not, you'll lose weight. Good luck!\" \"This is such a great start, and love thinking about this reverse.
